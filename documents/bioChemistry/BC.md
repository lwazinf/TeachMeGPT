#### Preface

The concept for this sub-series within the long-established Springer NatureSubcel-
lular Biochemistrybook series came to one of us (JRH) following reading the two
popular controversial books on ageing by the late Lewis Wolpert“How We Live and
Why We Die”(2009) and“You’re Looking Very Well”(2011).
Thefield of ageing is indeed large and expanding, so upon completing Parts I and
II of Biochemistry and Cell Biology of Ageing (series Volumes 90 and 91), we
realised that many exciting research areas had not been included. Thus, we embarked
upon the lengthy compilation of Parts III and IV. Even so, some relevant topics
remain to be included in one or more future books, and by then updates on some
rapidly developing topics may be required.
This, our third book on ageing continues the pattern already established by
including a range of interesting biomedical science chapters, each standingfirmly
on its own but clearly relating to the companion chapters and those previously
published. Following the introductory chapter by Professor Vera Gorbunova, Uni-
versity of Rochester, 15 further chapters follow (see theContentslist, immediately
following). It is clear that to comment here upon the content of these chapters is
inappropriate: all are worthy of perusal and more detailed study as up-to-date leads
into their respective research area.
We hope that this book will be of interest and value to established researchers,
undergraduate and graduate students in thefield of ageing and also those with a more
general interest ageing. The availability of e-books and e-chapters, often via insti-
tutional subscriptions with Springer Link, now increases the access of this material
to many. Part IV: Clinical Science will follow shortly and Part V: Anti-ageing
Interventions has also been commissioned by Springer Nature.

Vera Gorbunova and Andrei Seluanov

Abstract We outline the progression of ageing research fromancient history to
present day geroscience. Calorie restriction, genetic mutations, and the involvement
of the sirtuins are highlighted, along with pharmaceutical interventions, in particular
rapamycin. At the cellular level, replicative senescence and telomere shortening are
presented in the history of ageing studies. We discuss the roles of macromolecular
damage in ageing including damage to nuclear, and mitochondrial DNA, epigenetic
and protein damage. The importance inflammation during ageing“inflammageing”is
becoming increasingly recognized. Omics-based biomarkers are now proving to be a
promising approach, along with comparative studies on long-lived animals. The
science is getting closer to understanding the mechanisms of ageing and developing
reliable interventions to improve human health.

###### Introduction

Throughout history people have been searching for ways to achieve longevity and
rejuvenation. Thefirst emperor of China ordered an official search for immortality
potion. The Queen of Sheba used water of the Dead Sea to rejuvenate her skin, then
Cleopatra traveled from Egypt to build in search of the fountain of youth.
This search for longevity continues to the modern times but now with the use of
scientific methods. Ageing research had humble beginnings. For a long time, it was
believed that ageing is not a biologically regulated process amenable to interven-
tions. Evolutionary studies of ageing concluded that ageing is a result of declining
natural selection due to increased risk of death with age (Medawar 1952 ). The

second theory named antagonistic pleiotropy posits that alleles that are beneficial at
young age may become detrimental at old age leading to functional decline (Wil-
liams 1957 ). Hence there is no selective pressure to evolve genes that promote
longevity. Those who tried to study the molecular mechanisms of ageing were met
with skepticism.
This situation changed when it was discovered that mouse lifespan can be
extended by calorie restriction (McCay et al. 1935 ). Works inC. elegansshowed
that lifespan can be increased by lower temperature or food restriction (Klass 1977 ).
In the early 80th seminal studies in worms (Johnson and Wood 1982 ) and mice
(Eicher and Beamer 1980 ) identified genetic mutants that are long-lived, showing
that the lifespan can be controlled by genes. In the 90th the identity of the genes
responsible for lifespan extension had been revealed identifying the insulin/IGF
signaling pathway as thefirst regulatory network of ageing (Kenyon et al. 1993 ).
This was followed by identification of another network controlling ageing, namely
sirtuins (Kaeberlein et al. 1999 ; Kennedy et al. 1995 ), that when modulated can
extend lifespan in a variety of organisms from yeast to mice (Kanfiet al. 2012 ; Tian
et al. 2019 ; Tissenbaum and Guarente 2001 ).
The success in regulating lifespan genetically instilled confidence that pharma-
cological interventions can also be developed. Multiple drug screens were performed
in lower organisms identifying life extending compounds (reviewed in (Carretero
et al. 2015 )). Fewer compounds were found to work in mice, but some produced
reliable lifespan extension. Most notable compound that consistently extended
lifespan in a variety of organisms including mammals was rapamycin (Harrison
et al. 2009 ), an inhibitor of mTOR signaling. NIH Intervention Testing Program was
established to test life extending compounds in mice. In addition to rapamycin, this
program has confirmed several molecules including aspirin (Strong et al. 2008 ),
acarbose (Harrison et al. 2014 ), and 17-alpha-estradiol (Harrison et al. 2021 )t
extend lifespan in mice.
In parallel with organismal studies of ageing, our understanding of cellular ageing
has been developing rapidly. For a long time, it was believed that human cells taken
outside of an organism are immortal. This belief was challenged by the pioneering
works (Hayflick and Moorhead 1961 ) showing that humanfibroblasts are mortal and
undergo replicative senescence after afixed number of passages. The mechanism
behind replicative senescence wasfirst explained by Alexey Olovnikov, as an“end
replication problem”(Olovnikov 1973 ). This was followed by the discovery of
telomerase and telomere shortening (Greider and Blackburn 1985 ), and the demon-
stration that ectopic expression of telomerase can bypass replicative senescence
(Bodnar et al. 1998 ). The discovery of telomere shortening as the mechanism of
senescence raised hopes that extending telomeres will be sufficient to extend
lifespan.However, the realizationthat telomere shortening isfirst and foremost a
tumor suppressor mechanism, dampened enthusiasm for telomere-extending treat-
ments. Next, senescent cells were found to promote inflammation by secreting
inflammatory cytokines (Coppe et al. 2008 ), indicating that removal of senescent
cells may be beneficial. Thefield of senescence was revitalized by the discovery that
elimination of senescent cells in mouse models alleviates the signs of ageing and


1 Introduction: Progression of the Science of Ageing 3

even extends lifespan (Baker et al. 2011 ). This raised enthusiasm for senolytic
therapies (therapies that selectively kill senescent cells) as a life extending strategy.
We are still far from understanding the underlying causes of ageing and the
regulatory networks that control ageing progression. Attempts had been made to
systematize the knowledge about the causes of ageing by identifying a set of
hallmarks of ageing (Lopez-Otin et al. 2013 ). These hallmarks include damage to
various cellular components, most importantly, accumulation of mutations in
nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, epigenetic alterations, and damage to cellular
proteins with the loss of proteostasis. Ageing is also associated with telomere
shortening and induction of senescence through both telomere shortening and stress.
These processes lead to stem cell exhaustion and dysregulation of intracellular
communication leading to dysregulation of nutrient sensing pathways such as
insulin/IGF and mTOR signaling.
Since the publication of the“hallmarks of ageing”paper, additional hallmarks
have emerged. This includes increased systemic inflammation with ageing, named
“inflammageing”(Franceschi et al. 2018 ), and the demonstration that factors con-
trolling inflammation may have antiageing effect.
More recently, activation of junk DNA, mostly LINE and SINE transposable
elements emerged as an important driver of ageing, senescence, and age-related
inflammation (De Cecco et al. 2019 ; Simon et al. 2019 ). Strategies are being
developed that target these genomic parasites.
While genetic mutations are difficult to reverse, the discovery of epigenetic
reprogramming (Takahashi and Yamanaka 2006 ) opened a possibility that the
epigenome can be rejuvenated. Indeed partial in vivo reprogramming using
Yamanaka factors was able to rejuvenate mice, albeit with a risk of death and
teratoma formation (Abad et al. 2013 ; Ocampo et al. 2016 ). This works were further
expanded by applying partial reprogramming strategy to other tissues such as the eye
(Lu et al. 2020 ).
The studies of ageing received a strong boost from the development of omics-
based biomarkers and application of machine-learning approaches to biological data.
Thefirst such biomarker was the methylation clock that can predict biological age of
the sample based on a methylation pattern of a set of CpG sites in the genome
(Horvath 2013 ). This method allows quick assessment whether an intervention has a
rejuvenating effect without waiting for the experimental cohort to die. The methyl-
ation clocks are now being combined with transcriptomic, proteomic, and
metabolomic clocks to achieve a more accurate prediction of mortality.
Omics studies of ageing are rapidly developing, facilitated by progress in genome
sequencing and single cell technologies. Transcriptomic Ageing Atlases are now
available for the mouse (Tabula Muris 2020 ) and some tissues of nonhuman
primates (Wang et al. 2020 ), at singe cell resolution, and similar studies are under-
way for the proteome and metabolome. The hope is that integrating these different
platforms will allow identification of regulatory networks that can be modulated to
delay ageing.
Genomes of many long-lived animal species have recently been sequenced (Kim
et al. 2011 ), which substantially extended the bestiary of research models used for


4 V. Gorbunova and A. Seluanov

ageing research. Studies in long-lived organisms hold promise for identifying novel
strategies for longevity and disease resistance. A multi-species transcriptomic study
identified DNA repair genes and pluripotency networks to control longevity across
species (Lu et al. 2022 ) pointing out conserved mechanisms of longevity and novel
targets for intervention.
In the past few years, ageing research has experienced a rapid growth. Many
promising interventions have been shown to extend lifespan and improve health in
model organisms and human studies are underway. In addition to academic science,
Biotech started investing heavily into ageing research and there is an influx of novel
ideas. We are optimistic that geroscience researchers are getting closer to under-
standing the mechanisms of ageing and developing reliable interventions to improve
human health.

Abstract Nuclear structure influences genome architecture, which contributes to
determine patterns of gene expression. Global changes in chromatin dynamics are
essential during development and differentiation, and are one of the hallmarks of
ageing. This chapter describes the molecular dynamics of chromatin structure that
occur during development and ageing. In thefirst part, we introduce general infor-
mation about the nuclear lamina, the chromatin structure, and the 3D organization of
the genome. Next, we detail the molecular hallmarks found during development and
ageing, including the role of DNA and histone modifications, 3D genome dynamics,
and changes in the nuclear lamina. Within the chapter we discuss the implications
that genome structure has on the mechanisms that drive development and ageing,
and the physiological consequences when these mechanisms fail.

###### Introduction

Several theories have tried to explain why we age. Among them, the antagonistic
pleiotropy theory originally proposed by Williams in 1957 provides a reasonable
explanation (Williams 1957 ): some of the same molecular and cellular processes that
contribute to morphogenesis and embryo survival, after reproductive selection

pressure can lead to ageing phenotypes. More recently, the developmental theory of
ageing integrates the observations that several aged-related pathologies are the
consequence of a combination of genetic predisposition with environmental factors,
and that ageing is also affected by epigenetic changes that occur during embryo
development and are driven by environmental influence (de Magalhaes and Church
2005 ). Hence, understanding embryonic genome structure, dynamics, and develop-
mental epigenetic regulation contributes to understand ageing.
DNA is wrapped in histone proteins in the nucleus, and these proteins are
responsible for nucleosome formation to increase chromatin compaction. Depending
on the post-translational modifications made to histones, the chromatin will adopt a
loose or compact conformation, allowing or preventing the access of transcription
factors to the DNA (Fyodorov et al. 2018 ).
Global changes in chromatin dynamics are essential during development, differ-
entiation, and ageing. At the same time, transcriptional activation or repression of
genes is a consequence of the changes in chromatin epigenetic modifications and
nuclear organization. Among the molecular changes that are hallmarks of ageing in
several species are genome instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, and
cellular senescence. Interestingly, these features have in common chromatin
changes. Therefore, long-term maintenance of chromatin structure is required to
guarantee proper cell function. If it is compromised early or accelerated, pathologies
related to ageing such as progeria occur (Ahmed et al. 2018 ).
In thefirst part of this chapter, we describe general information about the nuclear
lamina, the chromatin structure, and the 3D organization of the genome. Next, we
describe the role of DNA and histone modifications, 3D genome dynamics, and
nuclear lamina changesfirst during development and then in ageing.

###### Nuclear Architecture

###### The Nuclear Envelope

The nuclear envelope (NE) is a double phospholipid bilayer composed of an outer
(ONM) and an inner nuclear membrane (INM). Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs)
connect this double membrane to form channels across the NE that allow macro-
molecular transport in and out of the nucleus. This highly regulated connection
between both membranes allows the nucleus to be responsive to environmental and
physiological signals through the association between the INM and the cytoskeleton
outside the nucleus and between the INM with the nuclear lamina and chromatin
within the nucleus (Burla et al. 2020 ).
The opposing forces from both sides of the nucleus provide the characteristic
round or oval shape of most cell nuclei. The cytoskeleton contributes to the shape
and stabilization from outside the nucleus by exerting tensile and compressive
forces. Micromanipulation force measurements showed that chromatin regulates
the force of the nuclear response to small deformations acting as an elastic spring,


2 Chromatin Structure from Development to Ageing 9

and simultaneously, lamin A seems to offer stiffness to protect the nucleus from
large deformations (Stephens et al. 2017 ; Wang et al.2018b).
These data suggest that the nucleus is a semiflexible meshwork with lamins,
chromatin, and the cytoskeleton regulating the nuclear shape stability and protecting
the nuclear material. The stability of the nucleus is required to maintain cellular
homeostasis since the perturbation of the NE leads to loss of nuclear compartmen-
talization, which is a hallmark of several pathologies such as cancer, laminopathies
(Houthaeve et al. 2018 ), and pathological cellular senescence (described below).

###### Nuclear Lamina

Underneath the INM, the nuclear lamina (NL) is a network of type V intermediate
filament proteins and nuclear membrane-associated proteins. Even though the con-
stitution of the NL varies among different cell types, in mammals, the main lamins
are lamin A/C, which are variants of theLMNAgene, generated through alternative
splicing, and lamins B1 and B2, that are expressed from individual genesLMNB
andLMNB2, respectively. Lamin protein structure consists of three main domains,
an N-terminal head, a ~45-nm alpha-helical coiled-coil central rod domain, and a
globular C-terminal domain. Furthermore, the three lamins undergo different post-
translation modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, or O-GlcNAcylation
in the case of lamin A. The assembly of the lamins occurs in a hierarchically ordered
polymerization pathway that involves homodimerization of lamins, followed by
assembly offilaments that form a globular protofilament of 3.5 nm with immuno-
globulin domains every 20 nm. Thesefilaments form a thick yetflexible layer of
14 nm localized adjacent to the INM, underneath the NPC (Ahn et al. 2019 ; Turgay
et al. 2017 ). A schematic representation is shown in Fig.2.1.
Some of the roles of the nuclear lamina are to maintain the structure of the nuclear
envelope, sustain genome architecture, influence transcription, repair, and protect the
nuclei against mechanical stress. The multiple scale organization and post-
translational modifications of lamins reflect the complex stabilization and the impor-
tance of their role in the 3D organization of the genome. Remarkably, mutations in
lamins are associated with diseases known as laminopathies, such as Hutchinson–
Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) (Houthaeve et al. 2018 ).

###### Chromosome Territories

Early studies by Carl Rabl (1885) and Theodor Boveri (1909) using optical micros-
copy suggested that interphase chromosomes are segregated in vertebrates and form
independent units, called chromosome territories (CTs); many years later, FISH
experiments (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) supported these observations
(Bolzer et al. 2005 ). In recent years, Hi-C, a high-throughput chromosome


10 L. Ayala-Guerrero et al.

conformation capture technique used to map the 3D genome organization of the
genome, confirmed that CTs are independent chromosomes with a subnuclear
positioning, with limited contacts between CTs (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009 )
(a schematic representation is shown in Fig.2.1).

###### Chromatin 3D Organization and Dynamics

The basic unit of the eukaryotic genomic DNA is the nucleosome, which contains
146 base pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer conformed by two
copies of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Furthermore, the H1 linker
histone wraps this structure forming a chromatosome. The interaction between these
units forms a 30 nmfiber, further organized into higher-order chromatin structures.
The chromatin compaction level is dynamic and facilitates several processes such as
transcription, replication, and DNA repair. Several factors regulate chromatin com-
paction, such as histone post-translation modifications. Here we refer to specific
modifications using a nomenclature in which the histone, residue number, and type
of modification (methylation, acetylation) are sequentially denoted. For example, the
addition on one methyl group to histone H3 at lysine 4 will be referred to as
H3K4me1. Chromatin compaction is regulated by additional factors, including
chromatin remodelers and histone variants; based on the level of such compaction,
chromatin can be roughly classified into two types: euchromatin and heterochroma-
tin (Morrison and Thakur 2021 ).
Heterochromatinis ahighlycondensed structure mostly contained in pericentric
regions and telomeres, and is localized at the nuclear periphery and surrounding the
nucleolus. It is enriched in the histone marks H3K9me3 H3K27me3 and has low
transcriptional activity. Furthermore, heterochromatin is classified into constitutive
(CH) and facultative heterochromatin (FH). CH is highly stable heterochromatin,
invariable, and primarily contained in repetitive sequences. In contrast, FH is more
dynamic since it can switch to euchromatin during development and differentiation
and responds to stimuli in a cell type-specific manner (Allshire and Madhani 2018 ).
On the other hand,euchromatinis a less condensed structure, enriched in the histone
marks H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K36me. In addition, theflexible folding of
euchromatin facilitates the binding of the transcriptional machinery, allowing a
higher transcriptional activity (Morrison and Thakur 2021 ).
The dysregulation of the chromatin compaction contributes to some pathologies
such as premature ageing. Also a global alteration of heterochromatin regions
contributes to the establishment of cellular senescence (Narita et al. 2003 ; Shumaker
et al. 2006 ; Tsurumi and Li 2012 ). These features are further described below in the
ageing section.

###### Compartments

Analysis of Hi-C data reveals that chromosomes are segregated into two types of
compartments, visualized in Hi-C maps as a checkerboard-like pattern that reflects
the separation of chromatin into active (euchromatin) and inactive (heterochromatin)
regions inside the nucleus, since robust interactions occur between regions with the
same type of chromatin status (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009 ). Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) of Hi-C data confirms the segregation of the genome into two
compartments. Furthermore, the identity of compartments A or B is also found
detecting epigenetic features: compartment A is more accessible to digestion with
the DNase I enzyme, is enriched in the H3K36me3 histone mark and in genes, and
has a higher transcriptional activity. On the other hand, compartment B has a lower
transcriptional activity and is enriched in highly condensed chromatin (Fortin and
Hansen 2015 ) (a schematic representation is shown in Fig.2.2).
Analysis of a higher-resolution contact map generated through Hi-C revealed that
compartments A and B are also partitioned into smaller domains called
subcompartments characterized by specific chromatin modification marks.
Subcompartments A1 and A2 are gene dense, have high gene expression, and
possess activation chromatin marks such as H3K36me3, H3K79me2, H3K27Ac,

(at the bottom). Genomic coordinates are indicated at map axes, and the interaction frequency
between regions is color-coded represented. (a) Whole-genome Hi-C interaction maps show
chromosomal territories as a high interaction frequency between regions in the same chromosome
that rarely interact with other chromosomes. (b) At the megabase scale, the Hi-C interaction map
shows a checkerboard-like pattern of low and high interaction frequency representing compart-
ments A and B, in which interaction frequency is higher between two regions of the same type. (c)
At the sub-megabase scale in a half Hi-C matrix, TADs are visualized as triangles of high
interaction frequency (black arrowhead), separated by contact depleted regions or TAD boundaries.

chromatin loop formed by the presence of convergent CTCF sites


14 L. Ayala-Guerrero et al.

and H3K4me1. However, A2 has a lower GC content and a stronger association with
H3K9me3 than A1. On the other hand, subcompartments B1–B3 have other marked
differences. Subcompartment B1 is enriched in H3K27me3 and has a lower corre-
lation with the histone mark H3K36me3, and subcompartments B2 and B3 lack both
H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 histone marks, but B2 is highly enriched with
pericentromeric heterochromatin and is especially enriched at nuclear lamina and
nucleolus-associated domains (NADs). Moreover, B3 is depleted of NADs and is
enriched at the nuclear lamina. Additionally, a sixth subcompartment, B4, presents a
characteristic pattern enriched with activation marks such as H3K36me3 and
heterochromatin-associated marks such as H3K9me3 and H3K20me3 (Rao et al.
2014 ).

###### Topologically Associated Domains (TADs)

At the sub-megabase scale, chromatin tends to self-interact in domains called
Topological Associated Domains (TADs) isolated from other TADs by regions
called boundaries. In a Hi-C interaction frequency map, TADs are observed as
squares of high interaction frequencies along the diagonal of the map, or triangles
if half the matrix (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009 ) (Fig.2.2c ). TADs are considered the
basic unit of the chromatin architectural organization since they are essential plat-
forms to maintain and regulate dynamic cis-regulatory interactions, such as
enhancers and promoters. TADs occupy 91% of the mouse genome and were
thought to be highly conserved among several cell types and species, with a few
exceptions (Rao et al. 2014 ; Dixon et al. 2012 , 2015; Vietri Rudan et al. 2015 ;
Battulin et al. 2015 ). However, recent single-cell Hi-C experiments reported a
notable variability at this scale, challenging this model (Flyamer et al. 2017 ; Nagano
et al. 2017 ; Stevens et al. 2017 ).
TAD boundaries have strong interaction frequencies isolating the domain that
they delimit. They have high occupancy of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and the
structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) cohesin complex, among other
features such as histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, repetitive elements,
and highly transcribed genes (Jin et al. 2013 ). One of the best-accepted loop and
TAD formation models is the loop extrusion model. It states that one or two cohesin
complexes are loaded onto chromatin; afterward, chromatin extrudes through the
cohesin ring until they stop at two convergent CTCF sites, creating a loop anchor
(Beagan and Phillips-Cremins 2020 ; Sanborn et al. 2015 ) (Fig.2.2d).

###### Lamina-Associated Domains (LADs)

The NL proteins interact with peripherally located chromatin regions called lamina-
associated domains (LADs), and they have been identified through different


2 Chromatin Structure from Development to Ageing 15

techniques such as DNA adenine methyltransferase identification, Hi-C, and FISH
(Guelen et al. 2008 ). LADs represent a silent chromatin environment enriched in
repressive histone marks such as H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 and hence genes with
low expression. As well as TADs, LAD boundaries are demarcated by CTCF, active
promoters, and CpG islands (Guelen et al. 2008 ; Pickersgill et al. 2006 ).
LADs are dynamic regions since they display periodic patterns of association to
the NL, depending on the cell type in specific cellular processes. During terminal
differentiation, the association of tissue-specific genes and linage commitment genes
to the lamina is essential to repress their expression (Peric-Hupkes et al. 2010 ). For
example, the artificial recruitment of genes to the NL in mousefibroblasts results in
the transcriptional silencing of those genes (Reddy et al. 2008 ). However, similar
experiments showed that not all genes recruited to the NL result in silencing (Finlan
et al. 2008 ). These studies suggest that the peripheral position is sufficient to repress
the expression of just some genes. Therefore, additional mechanisms to modulate the
expression of selected genes are also necessary.

###### Chromatin Restructuring During Development

Early embryonic developmentis an extensively studied process that involves pro-
found epigenomic changes to ensure correct spatiotemporal gene regulation. Con-
versely, deficiencies in epigenetic reprogramming lead to developmental defects,
diseases, and in many cases, embryonic lethality.
The zygote is the earliest stage of development; this single-cell embryo arises
from the fusion of two germ cells, the sperm and the oocyte. Right after fertilization
both nuclei provided by each germ cell are visible and are called“pronuclei.”They
fuse to give rise to the nuclear zygote creating the new individual genome, which
remains silenced for a period that varies in different species. In mice, the zygotic
genome activation (i.e., transcription form embryonic genome) occurs at the two-cell
stage and in humans between the 4-cell and the 8-cell stage (before that only
maternal mRNA is being translated). Development continues to form amorula
and then ablastocyst, an early developmental stage before implantation, where
cells commit to develop either extra-embryonic structures (derived from the
trophoectoderm) or the cells that will give rise to the whole embryo (derived from
the inner cell mass). Cells from the inner cells mass can be isolated and reproduced
in vitromaintaining their pluripotent capacity to differentiate into all the cell types in
the organism and are the so-called embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Establishing the
zygotic and early development involves epigenetic changes such as DNA global
demethylation, chromatin remodeling, genome reorganization, and transcriptional
changes (Fig.2.3a).


16 L. Ayala-Guerrero et al.

###### DNA Methylation

DNA methylation is one of the most frequent epigenetic marks in the mammalian
genome. It commonly occurs in CpG dinucleotides found mainly in promoter
regions of different genes. Depending on its abundance and the site where DNA
methylation occurs (inter- or intragenic regions), it can interfere with the correct
binding of transcriptional factors and different histone modifications that favor or
reduce transcriptional repression (Field et al. 2018 ). DNA methylation is catalyzed
by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), resulting in 5-methylcytosine (5mC), and
this methylation can be removed by 10–11 translocation cytosine dioxygenases
(TETs) that catalyze the oxidation of 5mC in intermediates such as
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine
(5caC), with 5hmC being the most stable and abundant in the mammalian genome
(Meng et al. 2015 ; Unnikrishnan et al. 2019 ). DNA methylation regulates gene
repression, genomic imprinting, transposon silencing, and the X chromosome inac-
tivation, essential processes for development and genomic stability (Bird 2002 ; Zeng
and Chen 2019 ).
DNA methylation is known for being relatively stable in somatic cells. However,
two major global demethylation and remethylation waves occur during germ cell
development and early embryogenesis. First, the 5mC reprogramming in the
germline ensures sex-specific methylation patterns; eventually, oocytes arrested in
metaphase of the second meiotic division (MII, where they remain until fertilization)
show moderate levels of 5mC, while sperm shows high levels of 5mC since
approximately 90% of CpGs are methylated. Moreover, parental genomes preserve
this tendency in thefirst stages of the zygote pronuclei (Kobayashi et al. 2012 ;
Smallwood et al. 2011 ).
On the other hand, the methylation reprogramming in the 1-cell early mouse
embryo is dynamic and involves the loss of parental methylation marks with few
exceptions in imprinting control regions and some retrotransposon prior to implan-
tation. Interestingly, parental genomes have different demethylation mechanisms
since the maternal genome goes through passive demethylation that occurs through
subsequent rounds of replication. In contrast, the paternal genome undergoes active
demethylation by enzymatic modification of 5mC. Ultimately, DNA methylation
reestablishes upon implantation (Cardoso and Leonhardt 1999 ; Gu et al. 2011 ; Inoue
et al. 2011 ) (Fig.2.3).
The change from pluripotency to lineage-specific differentiation is associated
with wide de novo DNA methylation. Mousemesenchymal stem cells(mESCs)
displaylowDNA methylation levels due to thede novo methylation and the increase
of hydroxylation. This demethylation ensures the plasticity and the pluripotent state
of ESCs. However, lineage specification is demarcated by losing the ESC plasticity
and acquiring a cell-type-specific identity. There is a global gain of methylation in
differentiated cells to silence pluripotency-associated genes. Simultaneously, there is
a loss of methylation in lineage-specific genes to allow cellular identity, reported in
many differentiation models (Kaaij et al. 2013 ; Meissner et al. 2008 ; Stadler et al.

Fig. 2.3 Epigenetic dynamics and genome folding changes during early mouse development. (a)
Schematic representation of early mouse development, from gametes to blastocyst, is shown. (b)A
Hi-C interaction map represents changes in 3D genome organizations such as compartments and (c)
as TADs with color-represented interaction frequency. The bars show the gaining of each pattern
during early development in both maternal and paternal genomes. While sperm show a typical
pattern of TADs and compartments, oocytes are depleted of both conformations. TADs and
compartments appear weak during thefirst stages and gradually appear as more robust patterns at
later stages of embryo development. (d) The gaining of the canonical histone H3 modifications is
color-coded represented, with gray regions representing the non-canonical pattern and white areas
showing the absence of the histone modification. While sperms show a canonical distribution erased
during thefirst stages in the paternal genome, oocytes and the early stages of the zygote maternal
genome show a non-canonical broad domains distribution of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. After the
2-cell stage, both maternal and paternal genomes reestablish the canonical pattern of H3K4me3. On
the other hand, the non-canonical pattern of H3K27me3 is present in both parental genomes and
remains until embryo’s implantation. During thefirst stages, H3K9me3 is mainly found at LTRs,
silencing their expression in a non-canonical pattern, and they are reestablished in gene promoters in
both parental genomes after implantation. H3K36me3 is lost during thefirst stages of embryo
development and deposited on active genes during the 2–4 cell stage. (e) The dynamics of histone
variants are color-coded, represented by bars in the gametes and by lines after the zygote stage.
While protamines in mouse sperm replace most histones, H3.3, H2A.Z, H2A.X, and MacroH2A are
stably expressed in MII oocytes. H3.3 is gained and reestablished during early embryo develop-
ment, while H2A.X is reduced in the 4–8 cell stage and maintains a low expression onwards, and


18 L. Ayala-Guerrero et al.

2011 ; Zhao et al. 2014 ). Interestingly, inhibition of DNMTs in stem cells decreases
the differentiation capacity of cells but does not interfere with their self-renewal
potential. These results suggest that methylation is crucial for lineage commitment
(Chen et al. 2003 ; Schmidt et al. 2012 ; Tsumura et al. 2006 ) (Fig.2.3f).

###### Histone Variants

During development, histone variants substitute the canonical histones (H3, H4,
H2A, H2B). In particular, variants such as H2A.Z, MacroH2A, and H3.3 have a
dynamic expression and perform vital roles during embryonic development, ESC
differentiation, and lineage commitment. A summary of the developmental expres-
sion and function of some histone variants are presented in Table2.1 and Fig.2.3e.

H2A.Z H2A.Z is a variant of the core histone H2A; it shares 60% identity and is
highly conserved during evolution. Its expression isfirst detected in the inner cell
mass during the early blastocyst stage before implantation, particularly in pericentric
domains (Rangasamy 2003 ). It is essential to embryo development since H2A.Z loss
in mice andDrosophilais lethal (Faast et al. 2001 ; van Daal and Elgin 1992 ). It is
enriched at promoters and enhancers of the Polycomb complex target genes in
mESC (Hu et al. 2013 ). Interestingly, these genes are marked as bivalent by
H3K4me3 and H3K27me3; this occupation is necessary for efficient self-renewal
and differentiation (Hu et al. 2013 ; Mikkelsen et al. 2007 ). Furthermore, H2A.Z
occupies a different subset of genes in lineage-committed cells, which could mean
that histone variants are another regulatory layer of bivalent promoters in ESCs and
that H2A.Z redistribution is necessary for cell fate transition (Creyghton et al. 2008 ).
In mESCs, the incorporation of H2A.Z enhances HP1a to form a more condensed
structure in pericentric heterochromatin (Fan et al. 2004 ; Rangasamy et al. 2004 ).
Contrastingly, it has also been reported that the binding of H2A.Z promotes chro-
matin accessibility by destabilizing the nucleosome structure and facilitates nucleo-
some removal (Hu et al. 2013 ).
InDrosophila, H2A.Z is expressed throughout thefirst 12h of embryogenesis and
decreases in subsequent stages. Ultimately, it remains with a constant expression
through embryogenesis. It is preferentially located at the heterochromatic chromo-
center of polytene chromosomes (Leach et al. 2000 ). InDrosophilaembryos, 65% of
genes activated during zygote gene activation are enriched in H2A.Z, which

Fig. 2.3(continued) H2A.Z is only expressed later at the blastocyst stage. On the other hand,
macroH2A starts expressing during the 8–16 cell stages. (f) DNA methylation dynamic is shown in
both the paternal and maternal genomes. After fertilization, parental genomes show global demeth-
ylation during the zygote stage, with the maternal genome showing a mostly passive loss, and the
methylation is later reestablished after the blastocyst stage

precedes zygote gene activation and RNAPII loading onto chromatin, suggesting
that H2A.Z is necessary to initiate zygote gene activation (Ibarra-Morales et al.
2021 ).

H2A.X The classically known function of H2A.X is its role to recruit repair factors
after its phosphorylation in response to DNA double strand brakes. Nevertheless, it
has additional physiological functions. In mice, H2A.X is abundant during thefirst
cell divisions, and its expression reduces and remains lower from blastocyst onward
(Nashun et al. 2010 ). However, it is not essential for embryonic development since
mouse embryos deficient in H2A.X are viable. However, they carry developmental
defects such as having a reduced size, lymphocyte deficiency and male mutants are
not fertile (Celeste et al. 2002 ).
H2A.X has not been linked to cell fate transitions but contributes to maintaining
the highly proliferative state of ES cells through its function in the DNA damage
response pathway (Adiga et al. 2007 ; Bassing et al. 2003 ).

MacroH2A MacroH2A is also a histone variant of the canonical H2A. It is
undetectable during thefirst developmental stages and appears between the 8-cell
and the 16-cell stage. Afterward, it is highly enriched in the trophectoderm and
differentiated somatic cells in the mouse (Costanzi et al. 2000 ; Pasque et al. 2012 ).
However, it is not particularly essential for development since mice lacking
MacroH2A1 and MacroH2A2 isoforms show normal early development, although
they have reduced prenatal and postnatal growth. MacroH2A1.2 is the predominant


20 L. Ayala-Guerrero et al.

isoform with low levels in mESCs, but it increases during differentiation. mESCs
from mice lacking MacroH2A1 and MacroH2A2 isoforms have no effect on their
self-renewal capacity (Barrero et al. 2013 ).
MacroH2A1.2 is found on developmental genes of terminally differentiated
genes occupied by H3K27me3 marks. It is associated with the repression of genes
through the interference of the binding of transcription factors and nucleosome
remodeling (Barrero et al. 2013 ; Gaspar-Maia et al. 2013 ). Correspondingly, the
loss of macroH2A altered the activation of differentiation genes in ESC (Creppe
et al. 2012 ).
It is also a hallmark of X inactivation since it is enriched on the Xi. Its deposition
depends on the inactive-X-specific transcript (Xist) localization between the 8-cell
and the 16-cell stages (Costanzi et al. 2000 ). Unexpectedly, the knockdown of
MacroH2A in mice does not affect the X inactivation (Pehrson et al. 2014 ;
Changolkar et al. 2007 ).

H3.3 H3.3 is one of the most conserved histone variants in eukaryotes. In mice,
sperm-derived H3.3 is extruded from the zygote after fertilization, and the maternal
H3.3 is incorporated into the paternal pronucleus in thefirst 2 h post-fertilization
(Torres-Padilla et al. 2006 ).
H3.3 wasfirst associated with active chromatin since 75% of H3.3 occupies
regions of active genes in mESC. Moreover, it is a mark of transcriptional activation,
enriched in transcribed genes, promoters, and regulatory elements inDrosophilaand
mammals (Trovato et al. 2020 ). In this sense, it acts as a nucleosomal cofactor for
p300 when H3.3 is phosphorylated at serine 31. Moreover, the loss of H3.3 in
mESCs shows a reduction of H3K27ac at enhancers (Martire et al.2019). Besides its
association with transcriptional activity, H3.3 has also been associated with hetero-
chromatin formation. In this regard, H3.3 phosphorylated in lysine 27 is essential for
heterochromatin propagation during the zygotic S phase in the mouse embryo
(Santenard et al. 2010 ). In both cases, such contrasting activity could be related to
different histone marks and the association of H3.3 to cofactors.
On the other hand, H3.3 contributes to the recruitment of repressive complexes
such as PRC2 at bivalent promoters of developmental genes and establishes
H3K27me3 (Banaszynski et al. 2013 ). Interestingly, H3.3 is also enriched in the
body of active genes but not repressed genes, which correlates with high gene
expression in mESCs (Goldberg et al. 2010 ). Moreover, during mESC differentia-
tion, there is a relocalization of H3.3 since it is particularly delocalized from
telomeres (Wong et al. 2009 ).
H3.3 has also been linked to regulating the balance between self-renewal and
differentiation of mESCs (Banaszynski et al. 2013 ). Its depletion in mice embryos
causes dysfunction of heterochromatin at telomeres, centromeres, and
pericentromeric regions (Jang et al. 2015 ; Wong et al. 2009 ). Moreover, loss of
H3.3A results in postnatal death of 50% at day 6.5 of gestation, and the surviving
animals show several defects such as reduced growth rates (Couldrey et al. 1999 ).
InDrosophilazygotesH3.3deposition onto the chromatin is mediated by HIRA
in the paternal genome, provided by the maternal genome (Bonnefoy et al. 2007 ;


2 Chromatin Structure from Development to Ageing 21

Loppin et al. 2005 ). Also, the replacement of H3.2 with H3.2K27 showed that
H3K27me3 is required for gene repression during early development. Interestingly,
Drosophilaembryos can develop to adulthood in the absence of H3.3. However,
Drosophilamutants of H3.3A and H3.3B have reduced viability and both males and
females are unfertile (Hödl and Basler 2009 ; Sakai et al. 2009 ).

CENP-A CENP-A (centromere protein A) is another variant of histone H3 basally
located in the centromere. It is involved in the nucleosomal packaging of centro-
meric DNA and mitosis. The dynamics of CENP-A during early development and
differentiation remain to be analyzed. However, CENP-A appears to be essential for
mouse embryonic development since targeted deletion of the gene encoding mouse
CENP-A causes mitotic defects and embryonic lethality at embryonic day 6.5
(Howman et al. 2000 ).

###### Histone Modifications

Histone modifications are essential epigenetic regulators for embryonic development
in mammals that influence the interaction of transcriptional regulators with chroma-
tin. Interestingly, inDrosophila, methylation is not a central epigenetic regulator
since the level of 5mC is particularly low. Only 0.034% of the total cytosine of the
adultfly genome is methylated. The lack of methylation inDrosophilasuggests that
histone modifications and variants are primary sources of epigenetic regulation
(Rasmussen et al. 2016 ; Takayama et al. 2014 ). A summary of histone modifications
along mouse early development is presented in Table2.2 and Fig.2.3d.

H3K4me3 H3K4me3 is a hallmark of active promoters since it recruits chromatin
remodelers and transcriptional machinery. Gametes show different patterns of
H3K4me3; in sperms, most histones are replaced by protamines. However, the
residual histones are still subject to modifications. In particular, H3K4me3 is
enriched in CpG-rich promoters (Gold et al. 2018 ; Hammoud et al. 2009 ). On the
other hand, metaphase MII oocytes show a non-canonical pattern of H3K4me3
(ncH3K4me3), where it appears as broad domains at promoters and distal
non-transcribed sites, particularly in partially methylated DNA domains, which are
deposited by the methyltransferase MLL2 (KMT2B) (Dahl et al. 2016 ; Hanna et al.
2018 ; Liu et al. 2016 ; Zhang et al. 2016 ).
After fertilization, paternal H3K4me3 is erased, and maternal H3K4me3 is
inherited by zygotes briefly. Afterward, both parental H3K4me3 are erased and
reprogrammed to the canonical pattern in the two-cell stage. In the following stages,
H3K4me3 appears dynamically along with the development and correlates with
positive gene expression (Dahl et al. 2016 ; Lepikhov et al. 2008 ; Lepikhov and
Walter 2004 ; Liu et al. 2016 ; Zhang et al. 2016 ).
Implantation of the mouse embryo involves a genome-wide wave of de novo
DNA methylation, except for regions primed for transcription, occupied by
H3K4me3; this may indicate that the H3K4me3 pattern form when DNA is

unmethylated and might provide a template for the genome-wide methylation
pattern, protecting genes from repression in later developmental stages (Greenfield
et al. 2018 ). Contrarily, loss of H3K4me3 correlates with DNA hypermethylation at
specific CpG of developmental promoters during mESC differentiation into neurons,
and genes that gain H3K4me3 show loss of DNA methylation (Meissner et al. 2008 ).

H3K27me3 H3K27me3 is a repressive mark found at promoters of developmental
genes, deposited by the Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC), and modulates
chromatin compaction. Interestingly, H3K27me3 also has a non-canonical pattern
in the mature oocyte. It is also found in partially methylated DNA domains, but it
resides in different subregions than H3K4me3 (Liu et al. 2016 ; Zhang et al. 2016 ). In
sperms, H3K27me3 is enriched at developmental gene promoters (Brykczynska
et al. 2010 ; Erkek et al. 2013 ; Hammoud et al. 2009 ).
After fertilization, the paternal H3K27me3 is lost and subsequently regained in
megabase broad gene desert regions, but with a low signal; this pattern remains until
the blastocyst stage (Zhang et al. 2016 ). Maternal H3K27me3 is lost at promoters of


2 Chromatin Structure from Development to Ageing 23

developmental genes, but the distal H3K27me3 in partially methylated DNA
domains remains until the blastocyst stage (Liu et al. 2016 ; Zhang et al. 2016 ).
H3K27me3 starts appearing at canonical polycomb target promoters in the
blastocyst, and a more robust occupation is gained in post-implantation embryo,
particularly in epiblasts cells. Distal ncH3K27me3 also disappears at this stage. The
maternal inherited H3K27me3 domains function as an imprinting mark, similar to
DNA methylation-mediated imprinting (Chen and Zhang 2020 ; Inoue and Zhang
2011 ).

H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 Bivalency Both repressive and active histone marks
demarcate bivalent promoters. In mESCs, bivalent promoters with H3K27me3 and
H3K4me3 were observed on the same allele (Meissner et al. 2008 ). Interestingly,
most bivalent high CpG promoters become monovalent in more committed cells. For
example, in neural progenitor cells, 46% of bivalent high CpG promoters resolve to
only H3K4me3, and concordantly genes show increased expression. On the other
hand, 14% resolve to H3K27me3, and 32% lost both marks. In both cases, genes
show low expression. The 8% remaining keep the bivalent pattern and remain
repressed (Mikkelsen et al. 2007 ). These results might indicate that bivalency is
necessary for a lineage-specific expression pattern and to poise developmental
genes.

H3K9me3 H3K9me3 is a repressive mark mostly found in constitutive heterochro-
matin. In the mouse embryo, H3K9me3 regulates the development by remodeling
heterochromatin, repressing repetitive sequences, and regulating lineage specifica-
tion (Allshire and Madhani 2018 ; Becker et al. 2016 ).
Upon fertilization, the paternal pronucleus shows no detectable H3K9me3, but it
starts accumulating in later stages (Burton et al. 2020 ; Wang et al.2018a). Interest-
ingly, global demethylation makes a significant fraction of repeat-rich sequences
such as LTR retrotransposons accessible for transcription, vital for zygote gene
activation. In consequence LTRs are silenced by epigenetic modifications, including
repressive histone marks such as H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in later developmental
stages. Concordantly, during early embryo development, the establishment of
H3K9me3 in LTRs correlates with their repression, while it is mostly absent in
gene promoters of both parental genomes (Burton et al. 2020 ; Wang et al.2018a).
Further, in post-implantation embryos, H3K9me3 is reestablished in promoters,
regulating lineage-specific gene expression (Nicetto et al. 2019 ; Burton et al.
2020 ; Wang et al.2018a).
Interestingly, in ESCs, H3K9me3 is present in constitutive heterochromatin and
transposons and lineage-specific genes, impeding precocious activation of lineage-
incompatible genes. Subsequently, this mark is removed in specific genes to allow
cell-specific gene expression (Becker et al. 2016 ). These results indicate that
H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin is a barrier to cell fate and must be
reprogrammed after fertilization.

H3K36me3 H3K36me3 is a histone mark involved in DNA replication, transcrip-
tion, splicing, and DNA repair. It is often found in the body of active genes and is


24 L. Ayala-Guerrero et al.

deposited by the histone methyltransferase SETD2 (Wagner and Carpenter 2012 ).
After fertilization, both parental genomes lose H3K36me3, which reappears in later
stages during zygote gene activation (Xu et al. 2019 ).
In mouse oocytes it is essential to guide DNA methylation through the recruit-
ment of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A/B and, thus, establish maternal
imprints (Bartolomei and Ferguson-Smith 2011 ; Chotalia et al. 2009 ; Xu et al.
2019 ). Also, it inversely regulates the deposition of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3
since SETD2 depleted oocytes exhibit both marks invasion in former H3K36me3
regions; also, these cells exhibit aberrant DNA methylome, the loss of maternal
imprinting, and embryonic lethality (Hanna et al. 2018 ; Xu et al. 2019 ).

###### Nuclear Remodeling in Development

The 3D chromatin organization is dynamic during eukaryotic development and
differentiation. During development, epigenetic reprogramming correlates with a
reorganization of the high-order chromatin structure, and various studies have
employed chromosome conformation capture techniques such as Hi-C to study
genome dynamics during these developmental processes.
Studies in germ cells have found that despite sperm cells having a highly
compacted genome, consequence of the exchange of histone for protamines and
the loss of nucleosomes in large regions of the genome during spermiogenesis, they
conserve 3D genome features such as TADs and an organization in A and B
compartments. However, the tight packaging of the sperm genome gives rise to
the enrichment of long-range contacts compared withfibroblast (Battulin et al. 2015 ;
Jung et al. 2017 ; Ke et al. 2017 ). On the other hand, the oocyte organization is
dynamic during gametogenesis. TADs, compartments, and loops weaken throughout
gametogenesis and disappear in the metaphase II oocyte, where it remains until
fertilization (Du et al. 2020 ; Ke et al. 2017 ).
After fertilization, the genome undergoes a dramatic reorganization. Early-stage
mouse andDrosophila melanogasterembryo have relaxed TADs and compartment
organization, followed by a gradual establishment of higher-order chromatin in later
stages of the embryo, especially after zygotic genome activation (Du et al. 2020 ;Ke
et al. 2017 ). Eventually, the number of TADs found at the 8-cell stage mouse embryo
is similar to TADs found in mESC (Ke et al. 2017 ).
Parental genomes remain separated until the 8-cell stage due to the formation of
two bipolar spindles around pronuclei that keep them apart in the mouse zygote. As a
result, both parental genomes undergo allele-specific reprogramming (Reichmann
et al. 2018 ). Low-input and single-cell Hi-C studies in the two-cell stage of mouse
embryo have reported that both paternal and maternal TADs and compartments are
markedly weak, compared with those in later stage embryos, and interestingly, the
paternal compartmentalization is stronger than the maternal genome, which could
reflect the nuclear architecture in oocytes and sperms (Collombet et al. 2020 ;Ke
et al. 2017 ).


2 Chromatin Structure from Development to Ageing 25

Conversely, another study applied single-nucleus Hi-C (snHi-C) experiments in
the G1 phase of the mouse zygote. It showed that both parental genomes contain
TADs and loops at similar strength when averaging contact maps over previously
annotated TADs and loops in CH12-LX cells (Flyamer et al. 2017 ; Rao et al. 2014 ).
Additionally, A/B compartmentalization was detected in the paternal but not the
maternal genome, agreeing with previous work (Flyamer et al. 2017 ).
Interestingly, TADs present after the 8-cell stage of the mouse embryo showed
different derivations since some show bias for the maternal or paternal genome, and
most of these domains disappear by the 4-cell stage. In contrast, other domains are
progressively gained symmetrically on the two parental genomes at different stages
of development (Collombet et al. 2020 ).
After the 4-cell stage, a rearrangement of A and B compartments has been
reported in mice embryos, and the expression of genes changes concordantly. The
expression of genes changing from compartment A to B tends to decrease, and genes
changing from B to A compartments tend to increase. This change correlates with
the unmethylated CpGs status since unmethylated promoters are enriched in A
compartments, which have higher accessibility (Ke et al. 2017 ).
Although the chromatin conformation establishes around zygote gene activation,
the formation of domains is not dependent on transcription. A study showed that the
inhibition of zygote gene activation withα-Amanitin in 2-cell embryos does not
block the establishment of high-order chromatin structures (Ke et al. 2017 ). Similar
results were reported inDrosophilasince TAD formation is independent of tran-
scription but depends on Zelda for TAD boundary formation. Concordantly, the
removal of Zelda leads to the loss of insulation of TAD boundaries (Hug et al. 2017 ).
Notably, blockingDNA replicationin 2-cell mice embryos does inhibit the estab-
lishment of high-order chromatin structures (Ke et al. 2017 ).
On the other hand, lineage specification is highly regulated and requires a
coordinated spatiotemporal expression of lineage-specific genes. For example, dur-
ing mESC differentiation into neurons, there is an increase in compartment size with
a decrease in interaction strength between A-type domains and an increase in
contacts in B-type domains. This compartment rearrangement could be explained
by the segregation of heterochromatin observed during cell differentiation (Bonev
et al. 2017 ). On the other hand, less prominent TAD domains changes were observed
since most of the boundaries are conserved through differentiation, with a slight
increase in insulation. Interestingly, interactions between enhancers and promoters
showed to be highly dynamic, and this was established accordingly with gene
expression (Bonev et al. 2017 ).
Similar results were reported during human ESCs differentiation since 36% of the
genome displays compartment switching. Interestingly, these changes in compart-
ments correlated modestly with gene expression since most of the genes remain
unaffected. Also, minor TAD boundaries were affected, although intra-TAD inter-
actions were dynamic (Dixon et al. 2015 ) (see Fig.2.3).

###### Lamins Regulate Nuclear Structure and Chromatin

###### Organization During Development

The nuclear periphery fulfills a vital role in regulating gene expression during
development and differentiation. Changes in the composition of the NL, the associ-
ation with chromatin, and the epigenetic landscape are part of the regulation of gene
expression through these processes.
DNA adenine methyltransferase identification experiments in the mouse embryo
showed that LADs are established de novo after fertilization, previous to TAD
consolidation (Borsos et al. 2019 ). However, their establishment in the mouse
embryo is dynamic since 42% of LADs detach from the nuclear periphery through
early development, but 70% of these LADs regain the association with the NL in
blastocysts. Surprisingly, 39% of LADs show colocalization with compartments A
instead of compartments B in the 2-cell stage, yet are associated with transcriptional
repression and adopt a more conventional pattern from the 8-cell stage onwards
(Borsos et al. 2019 ).
The paternal genome has broad domains, while the maternal genome has smaller
and more fragmented LADs with fewer lamina contacts. Also, it was reported that
the establishment of LADs does not correlate with DNA replication or H3K9me2/
me3. Interestingly, the overexpression of KDM5B, an H3K4me3 demethylase,
causes the loss of LADs on the paternal genome at the 1-cell stage, with no effect
on maternal LADs (Borsos et al. 2019 ).
These results indicate that during early development, the organization of LADs is
established de novo and matures through development in later stages, with the
parental LAD architecture converging after the 8-cell stage of the mouse embryo.
Nevertheless, their emergence is prior to TAD formation, which could help prime
repressive regions.
On the other hand, cell differentiation is characterized by the spatial segregation
of euchromatin and heterochromatin, where heterochromatin tends to accumulate to
the nuclear periphery and around nucleoli (Mattout et al. 2015 ). ESC differentiation
into neuronal precursors and differentiated astrocytes entail a dynamic association of
LADs with the NL, whereas up to 35% of the genome switches between A and B
compartments. Furthermore, genes that detach from the NL do not activate imme-
diately but are more likely to become active in subsequent differentiation steps
(Peric-Hupkes et al. 2010 ).
Although the precise mechanism by which the association of chromatin to the NL
regulates the 3D organization of the genome is not yet known, it has been shown that
the lamin A/C and lamin B receptor (LBR) are required to tether heterochromatin to
the nuclear periphery. For example, the loss of these proteins in the NL leads to
global relocalization of the heterochromatin to the nuclear center during the terminal
differentiation of rod photoreceptors in nocturnal mammals. The same pattern is
observed during neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis), a form of cell death used
as an immune response in terminally differentiated neutrophils (Chen et al. 2016 ;
Soloveietal. 2013).

###### Programmed Cellular Senescence

Cellular senescence was originally described when studying ageing, cellular dam-
age, or stress. However, a similar phenotype of cellular senescence also occurs
during embryo development, and hence has been coined programmed cell senes-
cence. Among the hallmarks of cell senescence are the expression of inhibitors of
cell cycle progression such as p21Waf1and p16INK4A, an increase in the activity of a
lysosomal protein that has β-galactosidase activity and is coined senescence-
associatedβ-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), and the secretion of molecules such as growth
factors, metalloproteinases and cytokines, collectively known as senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The establishment of programmed senes-
cent cells depends on p21Waf1sinceCdkn1a(gene coding for p21Waf1)-deficient
mice have a reduced number of senescent cells and an altered patterning of the neural
tube. The presumed function of SASP molecules during development is to contribute
to morphogenesis, as programmed cellular senescence is observed in organizing
centers during tissue remodeling (Muñoz-Espín et al. 2013 ; Storer et al. 2013 ).
Programmed cellular senescence is conserved in evolution, as it has been found in
mouse, humans, chicken, quail, Xenopus, axolotl, zebrafish, and naked mole-rat
embryos (Davaapil et al. 2016 ; Gibaja et al. 2019 ; Muñoz-Espín et al. 2013 ; Nacher
et al. 2006 ; Storer et al. 2013 ; Villiard et al. 2017 ; Zhao et al. 2018 ).
During mouse embryonic development, some tissues with programmed cell
senescence identified by SA-ß-gal activity are mesonephros, the endolymphatic
sac of the inner ear, the apical ectodermal ridge, the tip of the tail, and the closing
neuronal tube (Muñoz-Espín et al. 2013 ; Storer et al. 2013 ); programmed cellular
senescence also occurs in the spinal cord and notochord (Domínguez-Bautista et al.
2021 ). Programmed senescent cells appear dynamically through mouse embryo
development and after 2–3 days are removed by infiltrated macrophages. It is
possible that senescent cells complement apoptosis sculpture function during devel-
opment (Wanner et al. 2020 ). Nevertheless, not all programmed senescent cells are
eliminated by macrophages. Interestingly, some senescent cells lose their hallmarks
of SAβ-Gal activity and p21Waf1expression and re-enter the cell cycle in vivo during
embryogenesis (Li et al. 2018 ).
Programmed senescent cells have increased heterochromatin markers H3K9me3
and HP1γ, while no DNA damage has been detected, nor activation of p53 or
expression of p19ARF, which are typical markers of age-associated cellular senes-
cence (Muñoz-Espín et al. 2013 ; Storer et al. 2013 ; Domínguez-Bautista et al. 2021 ).
This might explain why programmed cellular senescence in embryos has a physio-
logical function, as opposed to the detrimental role persistent senescent cells have in
ageing and age-related diseases (detailed below).

###### Chromatin Remodeling in Ageing

Ageingis a biological process characterized by a progressive loss of physiological
functions that leads to an accumulation of damage at the tissue, cellular, and
molecular levels over time, increasing the likelihood of death. Among the hallmarks
of ageing, genome instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, and cellular
senescence (Lopez-Otin et al. 2013 ) have in common chromatin changes. So, it is
important to understand what molecular modifications occur in ageing that lead to
chromatin remodeling and what are their functional impacts on the cell.

###### Persistent Cellular Senescence

As discussed in the previous section, transient cellular senescence has a physiolog-
ical role during embryonic development. It also contributes to wound healing and
tissue regeneration. In the adult, DNA damage induces cellular senescence and since
senescent cells no longer divide, they prevent the onset of tumors in a cell-
autonomous way. Nevertheless, in ageing senescent cells instead of being transient,
they accumulate most likely because the immune system stops removing them.
Persistent senescent cells increase with age in many tissues and secrete
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) molecules that become harmful
in the long term. Among the molecules secreted are chemokines, cytokines, growth
factors, angiogenic factors, matrix metalloproteinases, etc. giving rise to several
pathological processes associated with ageing (Sacco et al. 2021 ). Age-associated
cellular senescence shares similarities with programmed cell senescence but has
some distinctive features. They have in common a phenotype characterized by a lack
of response to mitotic and apoptotic stimuli, mediated by the expression of cell cycle
inhibitors p21WAFIand p16INK4Aand members of the BCL2 family of anti-apoptotic
proteins, as well as an increase in the activity of the enzyme SA-β-Gal. Among the
hallmarks specific for cellular senescence during ageing are an accumulation of
lipofuscin, sustained DNA damage response, and alterations in nuclear morphology
due to degradation of lamin B and its receptor, which lead to characteristic changes
in chromatin structure. In the long term, there is a change in the composition of the
SASP molecules and they promote tumor development and chronic inflammation
(Paramos-de-Carvalho et al. 2021 ). The persistent accumulation of senescent cells
drives age-related phenotypes (reviewed in (Sacco et al. 2021 ).
Cellular senescence can be caused by different stressors such as telomere dys-
function, oxidative stress, radiation, proteasome inhibition, metabolic dysfunctions,
autophagy failure, and DNA damage (Schumacher et al. 2021 ), and it is classified
depending on the nature of the stimulus that induced the senescent phenotype. For
example, replicative senescence is induced by telomere shortening that causes
damage to its loop-shaped structure, which triggers the activation of the DNA
damage response pathway (Zhu et al. 2019 ). When the senescent phenotype is


2 Chromatin Structure from Development to Ageing 29

acquired before cell duplication exhaustion, as induced by chronic exposure to
different stressors such as oxidative stress, UV radiation, DNA damage, calcium
deregulation, and misfolded proteins, it is called stress-induced premature senes-
cence (SIPS). These stressors increase protein expression of pathways related with
inflammation or cell cycle regulation such as p38MAPK, p53, p21WAFI, and
p16INK4A, among others. Activation of oncogenes such asK-ras, B-raf, PTEN,
andNF1induces also the senescent phenotype coined oncogene-induced senescence
(OIS) (Tan et al. 2014 ).

###### Changes in Chromatin Structure and Histone Variants

###### in Cellular Senescence

In most healthy cells, heterochromatin is found in the nuclear periphery bound to
lamin B1 and its receptor, and euchromatin is located in the center of the nuclei.
During cellular senescence the reduction of lamin B1 and its receptor causes a
detachment of heterochromatin and a loss of its spatial location, leading to a global
modification of chromatin structure in which there is an inversion in the location of
heterochromatin and euchromatin (Lukasova et al. 2017 ).
A global loss and local gains of heterochromatin are also related to senescence;
for example, decreased trimethylation of H3K9 due to lack of proteins such as HP1α
or SUV39H1 induces SIPS in human embryonic stem cells (Zhang et al. 2015 ). On
the other hand, comparing chromatin conformation in normal human replicating
fibroblasts with senescentfibroblasts, the latter lose heterochromatin in promoters
and enhancers of active genes and gain heterochromatin in gene-poor regions;
constitutive heterochromatin in centromeric and pericentromeric regions become
more open, while the peripheral heterochromatic compartment is reduced and the
centromeric structure is enlarged (De Cecco et al. 2013 ).
During ageing and senescence, heterochromatin marks are distributed from areas
of constitutive heterochromatin (such as telomeres) to areas of facultative hetero-
chromatin (Zhang and Adams 2007 ). Particularly in cellular senescence, there is an
accumulation of heterochromatin domains known as senescence-associated hetero-
chromatin foci (SAHFs) enriched by marks such as H3K9me3, H4K20me2,
H3K27me3, and HP1 proteins that together contribute to cell cycle arrest, as they
recruit retinoblastoma protein (RB) and prevent genes regulated by the transcription
factor E2F from being expressed (Narita et al. 2003 ; Chandra et al. 2015 ). Also, in
WI38 cells, the formation of SAHF is mediated by the overexpression of HMGA2, a
protein responsible for chromatin structure, and by the reduction of the WNT
pathway, which inhibits glycogen synthase kinase three beta (GSK3β) (Shi et al.
2017 ). In addition, increment of nuclear pore components such as nucleoporin TRP
contributes to chromatin reorganization leading to SAHF formation, as observed in
an OIS model in IMR90 cells (Boumendil et al. 2019 ). Finally, macro histone H2A,
a variant associated with gene silencing, is also enriched in SAHF and is associated


30 L. Ayala-Guerrero et al.

with the inactivation of genes with proliferative function and the activation of genes
that contribute to SASP (Hao et al. 2022 ).
Chromatin remodeling during ageing contributes to the establishment of cellular
senescence. For example, the reduction of marks such as H3K9me occurs in pro-
moters ofIL6andIL8genes, which are two essential components of the SASP (Hao
et al. 2022 ). Moreover, accumulation of histone variant H2A.J in response to DNA
damage in senescent humanfibroblasts has been associated with the upregulation of
proinflammatory immune response and SASP-associated genes (Contrepois et al.
2017 ). Additionally, a study comparing the gene expression and DNA methylation
profile of cells with replicative senescence and OIS showed that genes related to cell
cycle progression were minimally expressed and those related with immune
response were highly expressed; only replicative senescence active gene expression
was consistent with hypomethylation in the promoters of genes, immune genes
related to SASP (Sakaki et al. 2017 ).

###### DNA Methylation

Thefirst studies on DNA methylation indicated a global loss of methylation with
ageing (Bollati et al. 2009 ). However, subsequent studies comparing the methylation
status in the intestine of aged mice showed that ageing leads to a more complex
epigenetic dysregulation, with gains and losses of methylation found in different
regions of the mouse genome, the most relevant being a hypermethylation in pro-
moters of tumor suppressor genes such asCdkn2a,Cdkn1c,Rassf1, among others
(Maegawa et al. 2010 ). Several studies have identified differential DNA methylation
patterns associated with ageing in humans and other animals. While age-related
hypermethylated DNA regions are preferentially observed in bivalent promoters,
CpG islands, and Polycomb target genes, other regions are preferentially
hypomethylated. Additionally, age-associated methylation changes are tissue-
dependent since no changes have been found in the methylation levels of adipose
tissue (Thompson et al. 2010 ) and in old rat livers (Guarasci et al. 2018 ). Even
though DNA methylation patterns vary among tissues, there are specific CpG sites
that consistently undergo DNA methylation changes with ageing and in age-related
diseases. Combining DNA methylation data with chronological age information,
several research groups have used supervised machine learning methods to“learn”
which CpG sites predict chronological age, and developed so-called“epigenetic
clocks”(Unnikrishnan et al. 2019 ; He et al. 2021 ). It has been interesting to observe
that in very long-lived people or supercentenarians, the methylation of their genome
is lower and slower (Horvath et al.2015b), while in pathologies that develop
characteristics of ageing, such as Down syndrome or progeria, methylation is higher
and accelerated (Horvath et al.2015a; Bejaoui et al. 2022 ). Accordingly, experi-
mental interventions such as caloric restriction (Maegawa et al. 2017 ) or rapamycin
treatment (Cole et al. 2017 ) decrease the apparent age of mice and monkeys, increase
their lifespan, and have delayed DNA methylation.


2 Chromatin Structure from Development to Ageing 31

One of the explanations for epigenetic deregulations in ageing is the decrease in
the expression of DNMTs proteins (Uysal and Ozturk 2020 ), which would explain
hypomethylation and a decrease in the enzymatic activity of TET proteins
(Borkowska et al. 2020 ), leaving hypermethylated zones. Consequently, the entire
gene expression pattern of the cell is altered, contributing to cellular dysfunction in
ageing.

###### Histone Variants and Modifications

Nucleosome composition rearranges with age, as there is a global loss of constitutive
histones such as H2A, H3, and H4 in aged humanfibroblasts (O’Sullivan et al.
2010 ). Also, in ageing, there are changes in the expression dynamics of different
histone variants (Yi and Kim 2020 ); for example, in post-mortem aged human
brains, as well as in old mice brains, there is an accumulation of the H3.3 variant
and a decrease in the H3.2 variant (Maze et al. 2015 ). Furthermore, in the hippo-
campus of old healthy mice, the H2A.Z variant increases and promotes the expres-
sion of early expression genes necessary for forming contextual memories such as
Arc(Stefanelli et al. 2018 ). In turn, in different tissues of old mice and primates,
macro histone H2A (mH2A) and heterochromatin one beta-protein (HP1β) are
increased, which are associated with facultative heterochromatin. Both increase the
expression of genes coding for SASP molecules, characteristic of senescent cells that
accumulate in ageing (Kreiling et al. 2011 ). Thesefindings suggest that the decrease
in nucleosomal histones and the increase in specific histone variants associated with
heterochromatin formation contribute to the structural changes in chromatin
described in ageing.
In addition to the decrease or increase in specific histone variants during ageing,
there is also a global loss of heterochromatin accompanied by a decrease in histone-
associated proteins such as HP1 (Lee et al. 2020 ). Specifically, in mouse cells, the
HP1 protein recognizes the di- or trimethylation of lysine 9 of histone 3 (H3K9me2/
3), which is a characteristic mark of heterochromatin that contributes to transcrip-
tional suppression and is also involved in the regulation of heterochromatin by
regulating the stabilization of protein methyltransferases and demethylases that
participate in the methylation dynamics of H3K9. Interestingly, aberrant levels of
H3K9me2/3 have been found in both cancer and ageing, possibly associated with
decreased HP1 and, consequently, changes in chromatin organization and decreased
transcriptional suppression (Maeda and Tachibana 2022 ). A summary of histone
variants along ageing is presented in Table2.3.
Changes in modifications made to different histone variants have also been
reported in ageing and age-related diseases (Saul and Kosinsky 2021 ). For example,
the H4K16ac acetylation mark regulates chromatin compaction both in ageing and in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD); in post-mortem human brains, it was found that this mark
is redistributed in normal ageing, having gains and losses specifically in the lateral
temporal lobe, a structure important for memory. However, unlike normal ageing,

this mark increases in the brains of patients with AD, having more gains than losses
in the same region increasing gene expression of different genes (Nativio et al.
2018 ). Also, in the brains of mice models of AD, there is a loss of acetylation of
different histones such as H2BK5ac, H3K14ac, H4K5ac, and H4K12ac, which
consequently decreases the expression of essential genes for learning and memory
such asArc, Bdnf, GluR1, GluR2, Syp,among others (Graff et al.2012). In brains of
older people compared to people with AD, a reduction of H3K18ac and H3K23ac
marks has also been found (Zhang et al. 2012 ) (Zhang et al. 2012 ). For a compre-
hensive review of the different histone modifications and variants in ageing, see
(Yi and Kim 2020 ). A summary of histone modifications during ageing is presented
in Table2.4.
Finally, other important factors that change during ageing are histone modifying
enzymes such as HDACs and HATs. These proteins move to different chromatin
sites with age, modifying the canonical transcription of genes associated with DNA
damage repair. For example, in young cells, remodeling proteins such as SIRT1 can
rapidly translocate to the site of DNA damage and then return to their original loci;
however, with the passage of time and the increase in DNA-damaging events, this
relocation does not occur, leading to loss of cell identity, cell dysfunction, and
ageing (Kane and Sinclair 2019 ).

###### Nuclear and 3D Genome Remodeling in Ageing

The previously mentioned epigenetic modifications in histones and changes in DNA
methylation determine changes in chromatin architecture and, therefore, nuclear
remodeling. Both in ageing and cancer, there are nuclear remodeling and changes
in the three-dimensional conformation of the genome. One of thefirst studies on the
organization of the genome in a model of ageing was done infibroblasts from
patients with the Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria Syndrome. This disease is caused
by the accumulation of progerin, a mutated form of lamina A, that modifies the
distribution of the repressive mark H3K27me3 in heterochromatin. As a conse-
quence, the lamina-heterochromatin interaction is altered. This is accompanied by
a global loss of the compartmentalization of active and inactive chromosome
domains (McCord et al. 2013 ). Years later, after a comprehensive analysis of
chromatin accessibility using the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin
(ATAC-see/-seq) in skinfibroblasts from patients with Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria
Syndrome, greater accessibility of LADs was found in chromatin, related to a change
in the expression of Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria Syndrome specific genes such as
EDIL3andIGFBP7(Kohler et al. 2020 ).
The histone 3 variant, CENP-A (centromere protein A), participates in the correct
position of the centromeres and the kinetochore assembly. In both aged and
genotoxic stress-induced senescent murine cells CENP-A levels are reduced, leading
to centromeric aberrations and genome instability (Hedouin et al. 2017 ). In tumor
and aged cells, the increased number of cell divisions compromises the

compartmental organization of the genome. For example, late-passage humanfibro-
blasts undergo a remodeling of compartments A and B; colorectal cancer cell lines
have a loss in the segregation of compartments A and B and gain in interactions with
intermediate compartments, which is characterized by the epigenetic mark
H3K27me3 (Johnstone et al. 2020 ).
Changes in the macrodomains of the genome such as the switch between com-
partments A and B and changes in TADs have been studied in the context of
senescence associated with ageing (Chandra et al. 2015 ; Rocha et al. 2022 ). For
example, in OIS local lamina-heterochromatin is lost and there is a gain in repression
marks such as H3K9me3. These cells also have SAHFs (Chandra et al. 2015 ).
Likewise, studies carried out with Hi-C in replicative senescence found a loss of
long-range interactions (>2 Mb) and an increase in short-range interactions
(<2 Mb); in turn, these cells undergo a change between compartments B (inactive)
and A (active) allowing a greater expression of genes related to cell cycle arrest, such
asCDKN2A(Criscione et al. 2016 ).
All the changes mentioned above lead to nuclear remodeling that responds to
changes in the three-dimensional organization of the genome. Changes in the NE are
highly dynamic due to membrane rupture, reorganization, sealing, or cell growth. It
has recently been proposed that this NE remodeling is coordinated with endoplasmic
reticulum lipid synthesis, and some enzymes responsible for lipid synthesis regulate
NE biogenesis and remodeling (Barger et al. 2022 ). This becomes highly relevant in
ageing since the NE must be remodeled with greater demand to content with the
chromatin changes described above. NE remodeling could cause deregulation of
lipid synthesis both locally and from the endoplasmic reticulum, overproducing
nuclear membrane and causing NE remodeling defects such as nuclear invagina-
tions, a phenotype observed in aged nuclei and with senescence associated with
ageing (Bahmanyar and Schlieker 2020 ; Pathak et al. 2021 ).

###### The Role of Lamins in Regulating Chromatin Organization

###### During Ageing

In addition to having a structural role, the nuclear lamina is essential for the
organization and regulation of chromatin. In ageing, there is a reduction in lamina
B1 and its receptor (Lukasova et al. 2017 ), while in both ageing and laminopathies,
changes in the nuclear lamina cause nuclear deformations or invaginations. Notably,
in Tig3ET cells with OIS, a decrease in lamin B1 and lamin A/C, and other NE
proteins alters nuclear morphology, leaving a nucleus more susceptible to apoptosis
or necrosis (Lenain et al. 2015 ).
Another vital function of lamins is that they affect the correct nuclear localization
of proteins. For example, the emerin protein is concentrated in the inner nuclear
membrane due to its interaction with A-type lamins; also, the histone-binding
protein HP1 interacts with lamin A/C for its correct localization (Ranade et al.


36 L. Ayala-Guerrero et al.

2019 ). Furthermore, lamin A/C interacts with p53 protein, which promotes the
degradation of repressor proteins such as PRC1, increasing the expression of
genes repressed by this complex, such as theCDKN2Agene that codes for the
p16INK4protein (Yoon et al. 2019 ). In turn, lamin B1 also regulates the correct
nuclear localization of specific proteins such as HP1, and the decrease in this lamina
is related to the loss of the H4K20me2 repression mark and, consequently, an
increase in expression of proinflammatory genes that are part of the SASP (Lukasova
et al. 2018 ). Finally, nuclear lamins contribute to the correct location of the telo-
meres. In particular, lamin A/C interacts with TRF2 protein, altering its location and
promoting the telomeres concentration in the nuclear periphery rather than in the
center, which is a peculiarity feature of aged or senescent cell phenotype (Wood et al.
2014 ). Furthermore, in cellular models of OIS, telomeres are also distributed more
towards the periphery, where they interact with the nuclear lamina (Lenain et al.
2017 ).
All these changes in the nuclear lamina lead to the destabilization of nuclear
integrity; in cellular senescence, small fragments of damaged DNA can be expelled
from the nucleus into the cytoplasm; these are known as cytoplasmic chromatin
fragments (CCFs) (Lukasova et al. 2018 ). These CFFs indicate the destabilization of
nuclear integrity associated with the previously described changes in nuclear lamina
proteins. Furthermore, mutations inLMNAgene cause the production of a truncated
version of Lamin A named progerin, and cause Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syn-
drome (Ahmed et al. 2018 ; Cenni et al. 2020 ), and increased expression of progerin
is associated with both ageing and age-associated diseases (Cenni et al. 2020 ;
Scaffidi and Misteli 2006 ) (Fig.2.4 ).
Alterations in the nuclear lamina induce changes in the pattern of DNA expres-
sion during ageing, and this could increase the damage events to genetic material and
causes instability of the genome. Particularly in ageing organisms, the ability to
repair such damage decreases, and therefore there is an accumulation of DNA
damage with ageing (Oberdoerffer and Sinclair 2007 ).
Finally, a common denominator between pathologies such as cancer, progeroid
diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and physiological ageing is that there is a
significant decrease in the ability to repair damaged DNA causing an accumulation
of DNA damage. This prolonged damage compromises the genetic information and,
consequently, the transmission of information from one generation to another is
altered. At the molecular level, DNA damage can affect the long-term nuclear
structure (forming of buds and micronuclei) which has been associated with muta-
genesis, chromosomal rearrangements, errors in DNA replication, point mutations,
translocations, telomere dysfunctions, and change in chromatin structure, that col-
lectively contribute to genome instability (Ou and Schumacher 2018 ). All together,
these alterations at the molecular level can modify cell fate, inducing the senescent
phenotype or increasing cell death; they cause inflammation, cancer, neurodegener-
ative diseases, and accelerate ageing. Therefore, it is vital that the cell frequently
monitors the integrity of the DNA and, if itfinds any alteration, activates the DNA
damage response, which recruits different damage repair pathways (Jackson and
Bartek 2009 ).

2 Chromatin Structure from Development to Ageing 39

###### Concluding Remarks

Development and ageing are orchestrated by similar molecular and cellular pro-
cesses, involving chromatin structure and genome 3D organization in such a way
that studying development can shed light into ageing, and vice versa. Chromatin
conformation dynamics and the plethora of molecular mechanisms behind genome
structure modulation have a direct impact on determining gene expression programs
during development and also during healthy ageing.
Cellular senescence is an example of the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of ageing,
occurring from embryonic development through adulthood and in the elderly, and
having both a beneficial and a detrimental effect in organisms. A key aspect of
detrimental cellular senescence is the secretion of SASP molecules with tumorigenic
and inflammatory functions. Since the regulation of the expression of the genes
coding for such molecules is mainly mediated by epigenetic changes, understanding
the mechanisms that lead to altered chromatin structure and 3D genome structure
could provide tools to either prevent or revert age-related gene expression. Should it
be possible to modulate the molecules secreted by senescent cells, the persistent
presence of senescent cells could be switched from detrimental to beneficial. This
possibility would be particular useful for treating senescent neurons, which cannot
be replaced.

#### The Nuclear Envelope in Ageing

#### and Progeria

Adrián Fragoso-Luna and Peter Askjaer

Abstract Development from embryo to adult, organismal homeostasis and ageing
are consecutive processes that rely on several functions of the nuclear envelope
(NE). The NE compartmentalises the eukaryotic cells and provides physical stability
to the genetic material in the nucleus. It provides spatiotemporal regulation of gene
expression by controlling nuclear import and hence access of transcription factors to
target genes as well as organisation of the genome into open and closed compart-
ments. In addition, positioning of chromatin relative to the NE is important for DNA
replication and repair and thereby also for genome stability. We discuss here the
relevance of the NE in two classes of age-related human diseases. Firstly, we focus
on the progeria syndromes Hutchinson–Gilford (HGPS) and Nestor–Guillermo
(NGPS), which are caused by mutations in theLMNAandBANF1genes, respec-
tively. Both genes encode ubiquitously expressed components of the nuclear lamina
that underlines the nuclear membranes. HGPS and NGPS patients manifest symp-
toms of accelerated ageing and cells from affected individuals show similar defects
as cells from healthy old donors, including signs of increased DNA damage and
epigenetic alternations. Secondly, we describe how several age-related neurodegen-
erative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington’s disease, are
related with defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport. A common feature of this class
of diseases is the accumulation of nuclear pore proteins and other transport factors in
inclusions. Importantly, genetic manipulations of the nucleocytoplasmic transport
machinery can alleviate disease-related phenotypes in cell and animal models,
paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions.

###### Introduction

Eukaryotic cells protect their genome inside a membrane-bound organelle, the
nucleus. The nucleus is the main feature used to differentiate eukaryotes from
prokaryotes, whose genetic material is not separated from the cytoplasm. The
nuclear envelope (NE) is a complex structure composed of a double bilayer mem-
brane (Ungricht and Kutay 2017 ). The outer membrane faces the cytoplasm and is
continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the inner membrane is in
contact with the nucleoplasm. At numerous points along the NE, both membranes
are fused, and associated with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which control the
traffic of macromolecules (“cargo”) between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Kutay
et al. 2021 ; Schuller et al. 2021 ). NPCs are supramolecular structures of more than
110 MDa, and composed of multiple copies of more than 30 different nuclear pore
proteins or nucleoporins (nups; Fig.3.1a). NPCs allow the free diffusion of mole-
cules smaller than 40 KDa, whereas larger molecules depend on active transport.
Structurally, the NPC is composed of multimeric subcomplexes that form rings in
the plane of the NE. These includes a transmembrane subcomplex, an inner ring, a
central channel and cyto- and nucleoplasmic rings. The NPC also containsfilamen-
tous cytoplasmic units and a nucleoplasmic basket structure. Many nucleoporins
contain hydrophobic intrinsically disordered domains rich in phenylalanine-glycine
(FG) dipeptides that establish a permeability barrier in the centre of the NPC
(Schmidt and Gorlich 2016 ). In order for cargo to cross the NPC, they interact
with nuclear transport receptors of the importin beta family (aka karyopherins). The
transport receptors come in twoflavours, importins and exportins, based on their
functions as receptors for nuclear import or nuclear export cargoes. The interactions
between nuclear transport receptors and their cargo are regulated by the small
GTPase Ran. In the nucleoplasm, Ran is bound to GTP because of the nuclear
activity of its guanine exchange factor RCC1, which stimulates disassembly of
nuclear import complexes and assembly of nuclear export complexes (Fig.3.1b).
In contrast, the activity of the Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP at the
cytoplasmicfilaments of the NPC stimulates the conversion of RanGTP to RanGDP,
which favours disassembly of export complexes and assembly of import complexes
(Schmidt and Gorlich 2016 ).
Beneath the inner nuclear membrane lays the nuclear lamina, a meshwork made
of lamin proteins, which constitute its principal component, and lamin-associated
inner nuclear membrane proteins (Fig.3.2a). Lamins are type V intermediate
filaments classified in A- and B-type lamins. The genomes of animal species encode
from one to many lamin proteins. In broad terms, the more complex is the organism,
the more genes coding for lamins harbour its genome. The nematodeCaenorhabditis
eleganscontains a single gene,lmn-1, coding for a B-type lamin (Liu et al. 2000 ).
Drosophilamelanogastercells express two genes, Dm, coding for a B-type and
LamC, an A-type lamin (Rzepecki and Gruenbaum 2018 ). Mammalian A-type
lamins are encoded by theLMNAgene, which through alternative splicing yields
lamin A and C. Besides, it produces the minor variants AΔ10 and C2. B-type lamins

are encoded byLMNB1andLMNB2, the latter rendering lamin B2 and B3 (Ho and
Lammerding 2012 ). The initial protein product from theLMNAgene, prelamin A, is
subjected to extensive post-translational modifications before yielding the mature
lamin A protein (Fig.3.3a). Thefirst modification consists in the farnesylation of the
cysteine residue within the CAAX motif at the carboxyl terminus, which anchors
prelamin A to the inner nuclear membrane. Then, a second modification is carried
out by the zinc-metalloprotease ZMPSTE24 that cleavages the peptide bond after the
farnesylated cysteine. The cysteine is next carboxymethylated by isoprenylcysteine
carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT) andfinally ZMPSTE24 releases the last 15 resi-
dues, including the farnesyl moiety. This produces the mature version of lamin A,
which assembles as a polymer in the nuclear lamina but is also present in the
nucleoplasm.
As aforementioned, the nuclear lamina also consists of lamin-associated mem-
brane proteins, which are part of a diverse catalogue of NE transmembrane (NET)
proteins (Worman and Schirmer 2015 ). The most studied class features the presence
of the LEM (LAP2, Emerin, MAN1) domain. LEM domain-containing proteins
connect the NE to chromatin (Barton et al. 2015 ). A mention apart deserves yeasts,
since they do not have a nuclear lamina but express LEM proteins (Steglich et al.
2012 ). Lamin B receptor (LBR) also associates with chromatin through interaction
with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), whereas barrier-to-autointegration factor
(BAF) offers a bridge between LEM proteins, lamin and chromatin (Sears and
Roux 2020 ).
The NE is physically connected to the cytoskeleton by means of the linker of
nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, which provides communication
between the nuclear interior and the cytoplasm and is required for nuclear position-
ing within the cell. The LINC complex is divided into two subcomplexes: KASH
domain proteins at the outer nuclear membrane and SUN domain proteins at the
inner nuclear membrane, which interact with the cytoskeleton and the nuclear
lamina, respectively (Khilan et al. 2021 ).
Nuclear shape is tightly regulated, and certain cell types feature distinctive
nuclear shapes; e.g. granulocytes (Deolal and Mishra 2021 ; Manley et al. 2018 ).
Nonetheless, the NE is a highly dynamic structure, as its size and shape are modified
along the cell cycle, with major changes taking place during cell division. When cells
enter mitosis, its nucleus divides following one of two main processes, named open

Fig. 3.1(continued) proteins carrying nuclear export signals (NES) or nuclear localisation signals
(NLS) through the NPC is facilitated by interaction with export (XPO1) and import (Impβ)
receptors, respectively. These interactions are regulated by the GTPase Ran and the distribution
of RanGTP in the nucleus vs. RanGDP in the cytoplasm confer directionality of the transport
processes. Impβcan bind NLS cargoes either directly or via the Impαadapter. (b; right) In cells
experiencing stress, for instance due to certain neurodegenerative diseases, several defects in the
nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery are observed. These include reduced levels of nuclear
RanGTP, detachment of nucleoporins from NPCs and formation of cytoplasmic inclusions that
contain RNA-binding proteins (e.g. TDP-43), nucleocytoplasmic transport receptors, lamins,
nucleoporins and other aggregation-prone polypeptides (e.g. poly-(glycine-arginine) dipeptide
repeats)

Fig. 3.2 The nuclear envelope and its alterations in progeria. (a) The NE is comprised by a double
bilayer membrane, NPCs, integral NE transmembrane (NET) proteins and nuclear lamins (lamin A
in blue; lamin B including farnesylation anchor in green). NETs containing a LEM (LAP2, Emerin
and MAN1) domain interact with BAF which serves as bridging factor between the NE and
chromatin. Most chromatin at the NE is transcriptionally inactive (closed heterochromatin). (b)
The NE in cultured cells from progeria patients is irregular (left) and accumulates less heterochro-
matin. A higher frequency of H2AX foci is often observed, indicative of increased levels of DNA
damage. In Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome, cells express an aberrant lamin A isoform

or closed mitosis, or in an intermediate mode. If cells divide according to an open
mode, the NE disassembles when mitosis begins, and reassembles after successful
chromosome segregation between daughter cells. NE breakdown includes disman-
tling of the nuclear lamina and NPCs through phosphorylation of lamins,
nucleoporins and other NE proteins by cell cycle-dependent kinases, thus coupling
NE disassembly to the cell cycle. On the contrary, in closed mitosis, chromosome
segregation during anaphase proceeds while nuclear membranes are preserved. In
this case, components that trigger chromosome movements must be imported
through NPCs (e.g. tubulin to polymerise microtubules) (Dey and Baum 2021 ).
The nucleus is the compartment where the genome is replicated and transcribed,
while the cytoplasm hosts translation of mRNAs into proteins and many post-
translational modifications. The NE constitutes a selective barrier that separates
nuclear content and processes from those in the cytoplasm. However, the NE serves
many other interesting functions that are essential for cell survival, integrity and
development. The NE affects these processes through its ability to regulate the
genome at multiple levels. The nuclear lamina determines gene expression, as spatial
localisation of genes inside the nucleus often affects their expression (van Steensel
and Furlong 2019 ). Some genomic regions are tethered closely to the nuclear lamina.
In general, heterochromatin, containing silenced genes and repetitive sequences, is
enriched at the nuclear periphery in contact with the nuclear lamina. On the contrary,
actively expressed genes within euchromatin are positioned more internally. Proper
3D position and dynamics of the genome are tightly controlled during cell differen-
tiation (Lochs et al. 2019 ; Cabianca et al. 2019 ). Chromosomal ends or telomeres are
also tethered to the nuclear periphery (Gonzalez-Suarez et al. 2009 ). During thefirst
prophase of meiosis, chromatin condenses into characteristic karyosomes: chromo-
somal ends attach to the nuclear membrane through the LINC complex, leading to
bouquet formation. This enables chromosomal movements and facilitates that chro-
matids from homolog chromosomes pair longitudinally to form the synaptonemal
complex (Zetka et al. 2020 ). The NE also plays important roles to preserve genome
integrity. Tethering of telomeres to the NE protects them against attrition, a charac-
teristic hallmark of ageing (Lopez-Otin et al.2013). Moreover, the NE participates at
different levels to repair DNA damage. Upon double strand breaks (DSB), the
nuclear lamina is necessary for efficient activating of the DNA damage response
(DDR) and the two main downstream repairing mechanisms, homology recombina-
tion and non-homologous end joining. DDR components, such as the DNA repair
protein 53BP1, are imported through NPCs and the nuclear lamina stabilises and
localises them to DNA repair foci. Finally, the nuclear lamina participates during the
orchestration of genome replication, which initiates simultaneously at many origins
in the nuclear interior and later at the nuclear periphery (Pentzold et al. 2021 ).

translational modifications including C-terminal farnesylation and internal cleavage by Zmpste24.
(b) The most common HGPS mutation interferes with pre-mRNA splicing between LMNA exons
11 and 12 and activates a cryptic splice donor site inside exon 11. This leads to an internal
truncation in prelamin A (aka preprogerin) including thefinal cleavage site for Zmpste24. In
consequence, progerin remains farnesylated

###### The Nuclear Lamina in Ageing and Premature Ageing

###### Syndromes

The NE is a highly dynamic structure whose composition and properties change not
only along the cell cycle, but also during cell differentiation and organismal ageing.
InC. elegans, in which somatic tissues are composed mainly of post-mitotic cells,
nuclei undergo morphological alterations during the relative short life of the animals.
Interestingly, most but not all genetic or environmental manipulations that extend
lifespan also delay age-related morphological deteriorations (Haithcock et al. 2005 ;
Perez-Jimenezet al. 2014 ). In mammalian systems, cultures offibroblast-derived
lines consist initially of cells without any apparent NE defect. After certain time of
cultivation (defined by number of passages), a variable percentage of cells present
deformed nuclei. This percentage increases with passages. Intriguingly, if the source
of the primaryfibroblast is an older donor, misshapen nuclei appear at earlier
passages compared to younger donors (Scaffidi and Misteli 2006 ). These misshaped
nuclei have irregularities in their NEs, including invaginations, blebs and


60 A. Fragoso-Luna and P. Askjaer

lobulations. Such alterations stem from modifications in the composition and orga-
nisation of the NE, which translate into loss of functionality of the NE. In particular,
the localisation of lamin A differs between primaryfibroblasts from older and young
individuals. Immunostaining offibroblasts derived from young donors reveals that
lamin A is located in the nuclear periphery as well as the nucleoplasm. In contrast,
fibroblasts from older persons concentrate lamin A exclusively in the nuclear lamina
(Scaffidi and Misteli 2006 ). Furthermore,fibroblast lines from older donors present
since early passages a decrease in histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation, HP1γ
and LAP2 and a concomitant augment in H2AX foci, indicating an increased
frequency of DNA damage (Scaffidi and Misteli 2006 ). Cells from old donors also
express higher levels of the LINC protein SUN1 and suffer alteration in centrosome
attachment to the NE (Chang et al. 2019 ). It is still unclear what triggers these
changes although preventing expression of a naturally occurring variant of lamin A
can reverse several of the phenotypes. TheLMNApre-mRNA harbours a cryptic
splice donor site in exon 11, that upon activation generates a 150-nucleotide in-frame
deletion in the mRNA (Δ150-LMNAmRNA), and a consequent 50-residue deletion
in lamin A, also known as progerin (Fig.3.3b). Strikingly, although the levels of
Δ150-LMNAmRNA and progerin are similar in cells from young and old donors,
inhibition of alternative splicing from the cryptic splice donor site rescues the defects
infibroblasts from old donors (Scaffidi and Misteli 2006 ; Cao et al. 2011 ). Another
study focusing on muscle samples from healthy individuals aged 16–71 years also
found similar levels of progerin across all ages and no evidence of increased use of
the cryptic splice donor site in LMNA exon 11 (Luo et al. 2013 ). Together, this
suggests that progerin expression in healthy cells is required but not sufficient to
induce the observed phenotypes of cells from old donors.
Progerin, however, plays a critical role in the development of Hutchinson–Gilford
progeria syndrome (HGPS). The principal feature of persons who suffer HGPS is
their aged appearance. They have a short life expectancy, 14 years on average, with
symptoms starting with growth retardation from their second year. HGPS patients
feature hair loss, marked veins in the scalp, skin stiffness, lipodystrophy, weakened
muscle function, and bone and joint abnormalities, whereas cognitive functions are
normal. The major problem of HGPS regards atherosclerosis and cerebrovascular
complications, which constitutes the principal cause of death (Merideth et al. 2008 ;
Gonzaloet al. 2017 ). HGPS is mostly caused by the de novo mutation c.1824 C>T,
which coincides with the aforementioned cryptic splice donor site in exon 11 of
LMNA. The mutation strongly induces the use of this cryptic splice site, yielding to a
pronounced accumulation of progerin at the expense of lamin A (De Sandre-
Giovannoli et al. 2003 ; Eriksson et al. 2003 ) (Figs.3.2b and 3.3b). HGPSfibroblasts
accumulate significant amounts of progerin, up to 50 times more than control cells.
These higher concentrations of progerin lead to more drastic alterations compared to
cultured cells derived from healthy elderly donors. Severe defects appear after fewer
passages in HGPS cells than in controls: HGPS nuclei suffer from more irregular NE
morphology, strong decay in H3K9 methylation, HP1 and LAP2, clustering of
NPCs, imbalanced connections with the cytoskeleton and an increase of H2AX
foci (Goldman et al. 2004 ; Scaffidi and Misteli 2006 ; Chang et al. 2019 ).In

agreement with the toxic role of progerin,LMNAmutations that further stimulate the
choice of the cryptic splice site cause more severe forms of HGPS and patients die in
early childhood (Moulson et al. 2007 ).
Different therapies have been developed to reduce progerin production (Harhouri
et al. 2018 ). Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides directed againstLMNAexon
11 reduce the activation of the cryptic splice site within this exon and alleviate
defects in HGPSfibroblasts and in a mouse HGPS model (Scaffidi and Misteli 2005 ;
Osorio et al. 2011 ; Harhouri et al. 2016 ). A second subgroup of molecules aims to
inhibit farnesylation of prelamin A. The farnesyl transferase inhibitor Lonafarnib
extends significantly the life of HGPS patients but only modestly, perhaps because
prelamin A can also be farnesylated by geranylgeranyl transferase (Gordon et al.
2018 ; Harhouri et al. 2018 ). Farnesyl transferase catalyses the prenylation of cyste-
ine residues using farnesyl pyrophosphate. In the same manner, geranylgeranyl
transferase requires geranyl pyrophosphate. Interfering with the synthetic pathway
that produces both prenyl groups partially rescues HGPS-associated defects. This
can be achieved with ZOPRA, that is composed by the N-bisphosphonate
Zoledronate and the statin Pravastatin (Varela et al. 2008 ). Promising results have
also been obtained with monoaminopyrimidines that inhibit both farnesyl transferase
and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (Blondel et al. 2016 ). As mentioned above,
prelamin A is carboxymethylated in its C terminus by ICMT. Inhibition of ICMT
through expression of short hairpin RNAs inZMPSTE24knockout mice and HGPS
cells induces the release of prelamin A from the nuclear lamin to the nucleoplasm.
Curiously, misshapen nuclei are still present, but other senescent features are
delayed (Ibrahim et al. 2013 ). Elimination of progerin by autophagy is another
therapeutic approach explored, including in clinical trials in combination with
Lonafarnib (Harhouri et al. 2018 ; Gabriel et al. 2015 ; Harhouri et al. 2017 ). Finally,
a set of drugs alleviates the defects associated with progerin expression, at least in
cell culture. Inhibition of the association of N-acetyl transferase NAT10 with
microtubules using Remodelin prevents progerin-derived NE alterations (Larrieu
et al. 2018 ), whereas stress in HGPSfibroblasts can be reduced with methylene blue,
N-acetyl cysteine, or inhibitors of Rho-associated protein kinase (Xiong et al. 2016 ;
Richards et al. 2011 ; Kang et al. 2017 ). Most recently, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
inhibition of progerin expression was shown to improve health and extend lifespan
of a HGPS mouse model (Beyret et al. 2019 ; Santiago-Fernandez et al. 2019 ).
Efficient and safe delivery of Cas9 (or related nucleases) throughout the organism
is still a major challenge for CRISPR/Cas9-based therapies, but this is afield
undergoing remarkable advances.
Mutations inLMNAandZMPSTE24can lead to other premature ageing syn-
dromes than HGPS. Mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD) type A is a recessive disease
caused by the amino acid substitution R527H in the C-terminal immunoglobin
domain of lamin A. The mutation disrupts the interaction of lamin A with other
proteins and around 10% offibroblasts derived from patients presents nuclei with
pronounced lobulation (Novelli et al. 2002 ). Mutation inZMPSTE24generates a
more severe variant of MAD (type B) (Agarwal et al. 2003 ). MAD individuals

display growth retardation, mandibular hypoplasia or retrognathia, osteolysis of
clavicles, bulbousfingers, alopecia, lipodystrophy, and diabetes among others.
Approximately a decade ago, another progeria syndrome was described and
termed Néstor-Guillermo (NGPS) after the two patients initially
diagnosed (Cabanillas et al. 2011 ). NGPS individuals share many symptoms with
HGPS patients, but they live longer, are taller, and do not suffer cardiovascular
problems. Nonetheless, they develop severe osteolysis which causes chronic pain.
Genetic aetiology of NGPS relies on a homozygous c.34 G>A nucleotide change in
BANF1, that leads to an A12T amino acid substitution in BAF (Cabanillas et al.
2011 ). BAF forms a ternary complex with Emerin and lamins. Moreover, BAF binds
to DNA, which facilitates anchoring chromatin regions to the nuclear lamina. NGPS-
derivedfibroblasts present nuclear irregularities and cytoplasmic accumulation of
Emerin (Puente et al. 2011 ).
Bonafide hallmarks of ageing have to accomplish three requisites (Lopez-Otin
et al. 2013 ). First, the phenomenon in question must appear or increase during
ageing. Second, its activation in model organisms deteriorates their health. Third,
its depletion ameliorates age-associated defects. Progerin fulfils the two last criteria,
but it is uncertain if it should be included as a true hallmark of ageing, because its
presence or increase is not clearly related to ageing. In contrast, prelamin A has been
observed to accumulate during in vitro ageing of vascular smooth muscle cells,
suggesting an implication of lamin processing in physiological ageing (Ragnauth
et al. 2010 ). Moreover, progerin affects other well-established hallmarks of ageing
(Gonzalo et al. 2017 ). Genome instability is a main feature of ageing and HGPS
fibroblasts activate DNA repair factors, as indicated by the increased presence of
H2AX foci (Scaffidi and Misteli 2006 ). Indeed, HGPSfibroblasts have defective
DDR, since upon DNA damage induced by irradiation, appearance of 53BP1 foci is
delayed compared to controlfibroblasts. Besides, once established, 53BP1 foci
persist, reinforcing that DDR is compromised in HGPS cells. Specifically, repair
by homologous recombination is compromised, as HGPS nuclei contain less RAD51
foci upon irradiation compared to control cells (Liu et al. 2005 ). Progerin also
interferes with replication, inducing replicative stress by sequestering PCNA (Hilton
et al. 2017 ). A transcendent discovery in ageing biology was that cultured cells can
only be passaged afinite number of times, named the Hayflick limit (Hayflick 1985).
Only transformed or pluripotent stem cell lines can be maintained, in theory, forever.
Later studies have found a strong inverse correlation between telomere length and
number of viable passages. As cultured cells divide their telomeres shorten while
progerin expression augments, potentially by a general increase in alternative splic-
ing. Moreover, mutations in proteins that cap telomeres lead to progerin increase,
whereas ectopic expression of telomerase, which extends telomere sequences,
decreases progerin accumulation (Cao et al. 2011 ).
Accumulation of senescent cells are one of the nine hallmarks of ageing (Lopez-
Otin et al. 2013 ). Senescent cells can be detected in most organs, constituting a
heterogenous class of cells. Cells entering senescence activate a permanent state of
no division, hyperactivation of p53, and a characteristic secretory-associated phe-
notype, acting as pro-inflammatory cells. Furthermore, senescent cells undergo


3 The Nuclear Envelope in Ageing and Progeria 63

major morphological modifications, including enlarged cytoplasm and deformed
nuclei with loss of lamin B1 being considered as a biomarker of senescence
(Hernandez-Segura et al. 2018 ). Progerin accumulation has also been proposed as
a biomarker of senescent cells (Cao et al. 2011 ). The downregulation of lamin B1 is
due to a decrease in both transcription and translation; the latter being mediated by
the annealing of miRNA23a to lamin B1 mRNA (Freund et al. 2012 ). Lamin
B1-depleted senescent cells display large-scale chromatin alterations and
compromised DNA integrity, eventually leading to release of chromatin fragments
to the cytoplasm (Ivanov et al. 2013 ; Shah et al. 2013 ). Moreover, lamin B1 is
required for genome stability and its depletion causes a delay in the onset of S-phase
due to replication fork stalling and deregulation of genes involved in DNA repair,
such as RAD51 and BRCA1 (Butin-Israeli et al. 2015 ).

###### Nuclear Pore Complex Turnover and Decline in Ageing

Several nucleoporins are extremely long-lived, which makes them particularly
interesting from the perspective of ageing. While most proteins recycle within
hours or a few days, pulse-chase labelling with the stable isotope 15 N revealed
that for certain nucleoporins, up to two-thirds of the original proteins were present in
the brains of rats for 6 months and still detectable after 1 year (Savas et al. 2012 ). By
cell fractionation it was determined that turnover of stable nucleoporins was lower in
neurons compared to glia, which correlates with the ability of glia to self-renew
(Toyama et al. 2013 ). Interestingly, the stable nucleoporins all belong to two NPC
subcomplexes, the Nup107–160 subcomplex and the Nup205 subcomplex, whereas
other NPC subcomplexes turn over much faster. The members of each of the two
stable subcomplexes have similar turnover kinetics among them but differ between
the subcomplexes (Toyama et al. 2013 ). This suggests that NPCs are extremely
stable structures as a unit with different exchange rates of the subcomplexes that
compose the NPC. Experiments inC. elegans, in which all adult somatic cells are
post-mitotic, similarly reported that the Nup107–160 subcomplex is expressed and
incorporated into NPCs during early development and not renewed later in life
(D’Angelo et al. 2009 ).
Proteins accumulate toxic damage over time, which is counteracted by protein
degradation and synthesis. However, the slow turnover of NPCs poses a challenge
particularly in post-mitotic cells, such as neurons and which is further exacerbated
during ageing. Analysis of protein extracts from brains of old rats found evidence of
oxidative damage of Nup93 from the Nup205 subcomplex (D’Angelo et al. 2009 )
and ~15–40% reduction of Nup205 subcomplex members in NPCs isolated from old
rats (Toyama et al. 2013 ). Strikingly, when incubated withfluorescently labelled
70 kDa dextran, nuclei isolated from either old nematodes or old rats showed a
dramatic increase in nuclear staining as compared to nuclei from young animals,
indicating age-related deterioration of the permeability barrier function of NPCs
(D’Angelo et al. 2009 ). Increased leakiness was also recently reported in a study that


64 A. Fragoso-Luna and P. Askjaer

compared muscle nuclei from old and young mice (Iyer et al. 2021 ). Moreover,
proteomics studies comparing protein abundance between young and old rodents
have detected different behaviours of individual nucleoporins and between tissues
(Cutler et al. 2017 ; Ori et al. 2015 ; Rempel et al. 2020 ). Age-related changes in
nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) was also inferred by comparing transcriptomes
of samples from donors ranging from 0 to 89 years of age (Mertens et al. 2015 ). Only
three deregulated genes were shared betweenfibroblasts, induced neurons (gener-
ated by transcription factor-based conversion offibroblasts) and human prefrontal
cortex: LAMA3, PCDH10 and RanBP17. RanBP17 is a nuclear protein import
receptor of the importin beta family and reduced RanBP17 expression was found
to correlate with a decrease in cells’ability to maintain nuclear and cytoplasmic
reporters exclusively in their respective compartments (Mertens et al. 2015 ). How-
ever, the natural substrates of RanBP17 and their localisation during ageing remain
unknown. Serial passages of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in culture
replicate aspects of natural ageing, such as accumulation of prelamin A and
increased frequency of DNA damage. These cells also present relocalisation of
Nup153 from the NE to intranuclear aggregates, disruption of the Ran gradient
and a concomitant reduction of nuclear import of 53BP1 (Cobb et al. 2016 ). Changes
in NPC stoichiometry and transport competence have also been reported in the
budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiaeboth during chronological (in non-dividing
cells) and replicative (dividing cells) ageing (Binai et al. 2014 ; Janssens et al. 2015 ;
Rempel et al. 2019 , 2020; Lord et al. 2015 ). Based on these observations, it seems
clear that NPCs suffer various age-related changes that may compromise their
critical role in NCT. As we discuss in the next section, this probably contributes to
the development of neurodegenerative disease.

###### The Implication of Nucleocytoplasmic Transport

###### in Neurodegenerative Disease

Ageing is a prominent risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases (Hou et al.
2019 ). Although neurodegenerative diseases are diverse in terms of clinical and
physiological symptoms, they all have signatures that overlap with multiple hall-
marks of ageing (Lopez-Otin et al. 2013 ), in particular loss of proteostasis, mito-
chondrial dysfunction, genome instability and cellular senescence. For instance,
signalling between the nucleus and mitochondria is essential for cellular homeostasis
(Lord et al. 2015 ; Romero-Bueno et al. 2019 ; Hou et al. 2019 ) but NCT is frequently
perturbed in multiple ways in neurodegenerative diseases (Moore et al. 2020 ; Liu
and Hetzer 2021 ).

###### RNA-Binding Proteins and Neurodegenerative Diseases

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) represents the best characterised connection
between NPCs and neurodegenerative disease. ALS is characterized by the death of
motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, causing progressive paralysis (Taylor
et al. 2016 ). Some ALS patients are also diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia
(FTD) and the two diseases share underlying mutations and cellular phenotypes. At
least 16 loci are linked unequivocally to the pathogenesis of ALS, with mutations in
SOD1, TARDBP, FUSand C9orf72genes occurring with highest frequencies
(Taylor et al. 2016 ).TARDBPencodes the RNA-binding protein TDP-43, which is
normally nuclear or reversible enriched in cytoplasmic stress granules but trapped in
cytoplasmic inclusions in cells of the central nervous system of ALS patients
(Neumann et al. 2006 ; Winton et al. 2008 ). The formation of these inclusions is
stimulated by ALS-linked mutations inTARDBP(Johnson et al. 2009 ), but can also
be induced by mutations in other ALS/FTD genes, indicating the propensity of wild-
type TDP-43 to formfibrils (Moore et al. 2020 ; Springhower et al. 2020 ). Most
TARDBPmutations map to the intrinsically disordered region of TDP-43 and are
thought to change the equilibrium between formation of physiological stress gran-
ules and toxic inclusions (Taylor et al. 2016 ; Moore et al. 2020 ). It is unclear if the
pathogenic inclusions are derived from stress granules, but mutant TDP-43 can
sequester multiple nucleoporins and NCT factors to stress granules (Zhang et al.
2018 ) (Fig.3.1b). Furthermore, inhibition of stress granule formation rescues NCT
defects and suppresses neurodegeneration in aDrosophilaALS model (Zhang et al.
2018 ). Affinity purification of soluble and aggregated TDP-43 from neuroblastoma
cells revealed a strong enrichment for nucleoporins: 14 were found more frequently
in the aggregates, whereas 2 interacted more strongly with soluble TDP-43 (Chou
et al. 2018 ) (Fig.3.1a). Nup205 was also detected in TDP-43-positive inclusions in
ALS brain tissues, whereas co-aggregation of Nup98, Nup153 and Nup214 with
TDP-43 in neuroblastoma cells was dependent on prion-like domains within their
FG-repeat regions (Chou et al. 2018 ). Recently, relocalisation of Nup98 from NPC
to the cytoplasm was also reported in neurons from progranulin mutant mice that
represent another example of FTD with TDP-43 aggregates (Zhang et al. 2020 ).
While it seems clear that TDP-43 can recruit nucleoporins to inclusions, alterations
in NPC function may occur prior to TDP-43 mislocalisation (Coyne et al. 2021 ).
Interestingly, TDP-43 in inclusions is not associated with mRNA, and, conversely,
binding of TDP-43 to mRNA can reduce formation of inclusions (Mann et al. 2019 ).
This suggests that the ratio between TDP-43 and mRNA is important for assembly of
pathological TDP-43 inclusions and that this ratio is affected by the efficiency of
NCT. Moreover, the transport receptors Importin-α(Impα) and Impβ1 (aka Kapβ1)
which are responsible for nuclear import of TDP-43 act as chaperones to prevent
aggregation of TDP-43 in vitro (Guo et al. 2018 ).
Other RNA-binding proteins found to accumulate in inclusions in samples from
ALS and FTD patients include FET (FUS, EWS, TAF15) and hnRNP A1/A2
proteins, which also contain intrinsically disordered regions (Springhower et al.


66 A. Fragoso-Luna and P. Askjaer

2020 ). Similar to TDP-43, FET and hnRNP A1/A2 proteins are mainly nuclear
although also found in cytoplasmic stress granules and their solubility is regulated by
interaction with a nuclear transport receptor, in this case Transportin-1 (Kapβ2) (Guo
et al. 2018 ). Interestingly, overexpression of Kapβ2 can rescue muscle degeneration
inDrosophilacaused by hnRNP A2 aggregation, providing in vivo evidence for the
role of the NCT machinery in regulating protein homeostasis (Guo et al. 2018 ).
Further evidencewas provided in a recent study that found that expression of
ALS-mutant FUS in motor neurons perturbed the distribution of Ran, led to dimin-
ished nucleoporin levels in the NE and reduced both nuclear import and export rates
(Lin et al. 2021 ).

###### Peptide Repeat Toxicity and NPC Function

The most common single-gene dominant mutation responsible for ALS is an expan-
sion of an intronic GGGGCC repeat in theC9orf72gene (Taylor et al.2016). The
gene harbours less than ~20 repeats in healthy persons and up to several hundred in
ALS and FTD patients. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain why the
expansion induces neurodegenerations and evidence exists for at least three: (1) the
expansion reduces C9orf72 expression from the affected allele, causing
haploinsufficiency, (2) formation of RNA foci consisting of stable sense and anti-
sense transcripts and (3) translation of poly-dipeptides by repeat-associated
non-AUG (RAN) translation (see references in (Moore et al. 2020 )).
When expressed inDrosophila, GGGGCC dose and length-dependent toxicity as
well as poly-(glycine-proline) and poly-(glycine-arginine) dipeptide repeat accumu-
lation arising from RAN translation are observed in multiple tissues (Freibaum et al.
2015 ). Two genetic screens in thefly model identified many NE-associated proteins
as either enhancers (E) or suppressors (S) of GGGGCC-induced phenotypes when
mutated or knocked down. Hits included nucleoporins Nup107 (S in both screens),
Nup50 (S/E; opposing effects in the two screens), Nup93 (E), Nup153 (E), Nup160
(S), Nup98–96 (S), nuclear transport receptors Kapβ2 (E in both screens), Crm1
(E in both screens), components of the GTPase Ran cycle (E in both screens) and
several RNA-binding factors (Freibaum et al. 2015 ; Boeynaems et al. 2016 ). More-
over, expression of the expanded GGGGCC repeat interfered with nuclear protein
import and RNA export both inDrosophilaand human induced pluripotent stem cell
(iPSC), thus providing evidence for a NCT defect caused byC9orf72mutation
(Freibaum et al. 2015 ; Zhang et al. 2015 ). Further support for this was provided
by a systematic screen inS. cerevisiaewhich found that overexpression of six
nuclear transport receptors including KAP104 (Kapβ2) suppressed poly-(proline-
arginine) dipeptide toxicity, whereas overexpression of nucleoporin NDC1 or Ran’s
guanine nucleotide exchange factor SRM1/RCC1 enhanced toxicity (Jovicic et al.
2015 ). Poly-(glycine-arginine) and poly-(proline-arginine) dipeptides are capable of
sequestering multiple transport receptors and nucleoporins in insoluble aggregates,
but, remarkably, the dipeptides also inhibit Kapβ1-mediated nuclear protein import


3 The Nuclear Envelope in Ageing and Progeria 67

under conditions without formation of aggregates, arguing that they might also
possess aggregation-independent toxic effects (Hayes et al. 2020 ). The disruption
of NCT by poly-dipeptides also alters the distribution of the transcription factor
TFEB, leading to impaired autophagy and thereby accelerated formation of aggre-
gates and eventually neuron death (Cunningham et al. 2020 ).
Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of the CAG repeat found in
theHTTgene. This leads to the synthesis of the Huntingtin (HTT) protein with a
polyglutamine (polyQ) tract with more than ~40 residues in HD patients as com-
pared to ~10–30 residues in healthy individuals. The expansion of the polyQ tract
causes HTT to form aggregates that sequester numerous other proteins including
lamin B and several FG-repeat nucleoporins (Suhr et al. 2001 ) and perturb NCT
(Woerner et al. 2016 ). In young HD mice, the aggregates appear initially intranuclear
where they accumulate RanGAP1, Nup62, and Gle1 (Gasset-Rosa et al. 2017 ;
Grima et al. 2017 ). These defects coincide with alterations in NE morphology and
appearance of DNA damage foci, which become more severe during ageing. Inter-
estingly, either overexpression of Ran and RanGAP or drug-mediated manipulation
of NCT protects primary cortical neurons andDrosophilaagainst the toxic effects of
HTT with polyQ expansion (Grima et al. 2017 ).

###### Additional Implications of NCT in Neurodegenerative Diseases

TDP-43 inclusions are not specific to ALS and FTD: they appear frequently in HD,
Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (Moore et al. 2020 ). Similarly, the
microtubule-associated protein tau is linked to several neurodegenerative diseases,
including FTD and AD. Aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary
tangles is a hallmark of AD and was recently found to colocalise with Nup98 in brain
samples from AD patients (Eftekharzadeh et al.2018). In contrast to the large
number of nucleoporins found in TDP-43 inclusions described above, the accumu-
lation of phospho-tau seemed to affect Nup98 (and perhaps Nup62) more specifi-
cally, arguing that NPC composition is largely unaffected in AD. Nevertheless,
physical interaction of Nup98 with Tau in the cytoplasm and at NPCs disrupts the
gradient of Ran across the nuclear envelope, impairs the permeability barrier of the
NPC and interferes with NCT (Eftekharzadeh et al. 2018 ). These defects may
explain other phenotypes observed in AD and related to NCT, including
mislocalisation of Impα(Lee et al. 2006 ).
Parkinson ’sdisease (PD) is caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. A
potential involvement of NCT was proposed more than two decades ago after
detecting a dramatic accumulation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in the
nuclei of mesencephalon neurons of PD patients (Hunot et al. 1997 ). Moreover, it
was reported that inactivation of oneNUP358allele in mice increases the sensitivity
to the neurotoxin MPTP, which reproduces PD phenotypes although a direct link to
impaired NCT has not been established (Cho et al. 2012 ).


68 A. Fragoso-Luna and P. Askjaer

Returning to ALS as the pathology with most evidence for a role of NCT in
disease progression, a recent study found that ectopic expression of an ALS mutant
form of the actin-binding protein PFN1 impairs NCT (Giampetruzzi et al. 2019 ).
Several nucleoporins including Nup358 and POM121 as well as RanGAP were
delocalised from NPCs in cells expressing mutant PFN1 and the nucleocytoplasmic
Ran gradient was perturbed. Although mutant PFN1 forms cytoplasmic inclusions,
the detached NPC components did not accumulate in these structures (Giampetruzzi
et al. 2019 ), which differs from the TDP-43 aggregates described above (Chou et al.
2018 ). Restoration of actin polymerisation in PFN1 mutant cells by overexpression
of a constitutively active form of mDia1 rescued the defects in nucleoporin and
RanGAP localisation and NCT. Importantly, the constitutively active form of mDia1
was also able to alleviate multiple defects induced by GGGGCC repeat expansion,
arguing that actin polymerisation is critically involved in ALS, regardless of the
underlying mutations (Giampetruzzi et al. 2019 ).

###### Concluding Remarks

Several alterations are observed in the NE during normal and premature ageing,
affecting in particular the nuclear lamina and NPCs. Special attention is focused on
progerin, a minor splice variant of theLMNAgene because mutations leading to
progerin accumulation cause progeria. Nonetheless, it remains an open question if
progerin constitutes a true hallmark of physiological ageing. On the other hand, loss
of lamin B1 is well-established as a feature of senescent cells. NPCs are
characterised by a remarkably slow turnover of several of its components, which
may affect its permeability barrier function during ageing. Moreover,
nucleocytoplasmic transport is impaired in multiple age-associated neurodegenera-
tive diseases (e.g. Parkinson, Alzheimer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and
several nucleoporins have been identified as promising therapeutic targets. The
wealth of interesting and recent discoveries described in this chapter illustrates the
pace of research in afield with broad implications for human health.

#### Mitochondrial DNA Mutations and Ageing

Julia C. Whitehall, Anna L. M. Smith, and Laura C. Greaves

Abstract Mitochondria are subcellular organelles present in most eukaryotic cells
which play a significant role in numerous aspects of cell biology. These include
carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism to generate cellular energy through oxidative
phosphorylation, apoptosis, cell signalling, haem biosynthesis and reactive oxygen
species production. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a feature of many human ageing
tissues, and since the discovery that mitochondrial DNA mutations were a major
underlying cause of changes in oxidative phosphorylation capacity, it has been
proposed that they have a role in human ageing. However, there is still much debate
on whether mitochondrial DNA mutations play a causal role in ageing or are simply
a consequence of the ageing process. This chapter describes the structure of mam-
malian mitochondria, and the unique features of mitochondrial genetics, and reviews
the current evidence surrounding the role of mitochondrial DNA mutations in the
ageing process. It then focusses on more recent discoveries regarding the role of
mitochondrial dysfunction in stem cell ageing and age-related inflammation.

###### Introduction

Ageing is the complex accumulation of random cellular and molecular damage that
leads to a progressive decline in tissue and organ function, resulting in age-related
disease and ultimately, death. Many evolutionary theories addressing how and why
ageing occurs have been proposed and can be seen to date back to the late nineteenth
century (Weismann 1891 ). Breakthroughs in scientific research and the revelation

that the ageing process is modifiable by caloric restriction (Weindruch 1996 ), have
steered biomedical research towards understanding the molecular mechanisms of
ageing. Alongside this, a decline in early-midlife mortality and increase in life
expectancy have occurred creating a social and economic burden on society. For
many chronic illnesses such as cancer and neurodegenerative disease, ageing is the
biggest risk factor and as such, establishing the existence of biomarkers, innate
mechanisms and influential exogenous factors which may help or be manipulated to
protect or treat age-related dysfunction and disease, is in great demand.
One of the most well-known molecular theories of ageing, the mitochondrial free
radical theory of ageing (MTFRA) (Harman 1972 ), centres on the fact that mito-
chondria are the major cell intrinsic producers of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
(Loschen et al. 1971 ; Chance et al. 1979 ). ROS are highly reactive molecules
capable of damaging intracellular proteins, lipids and DNA and as such the
MFRTA stipulated that mitochondrial respiration controlled the ageing process.
However, since the original proposal of the MFRTA, the significance of mitochon-
drial ROS in ageing has come under scrutiny, as ROS have also been shown to have
essential roles in maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis. Therefore the study of
the role of mitochondria in the ageing process has broadened to include investigation
of numerous essential aspects of mitochondrial physiology. Moreover, a direct
causal relationship of mitochondrial alterations in the ageing process cannot be
deemed from the mere presence of mitochondrial dysfunction within cells and
tissues, and at present there are many contradictory theories and reports within the
field of mitochondrial biology. Here we review the current evidence surrounding the
role of mitochondrial dysfunction in ageing with a focus on recent developments
regarding mitochondrial function in stem cell ageing and inflammation.

###### Mitochondrial Structure and Function

Mitochondria are semi-autonomous organelles thought to have evolved from the
endosymbiosis of a free livingα-proteobacterium into a eukaryotic cell (Gray 2012 ;
Gray et al. 1999 ). Present in the majority of eukaryotic cells, the mitochondrion is
rod-like shaped, encompassing an outer (OMM) and an inner (IMM) mitochondrial
membrane with inner protruding folds termed cristae that envelope the mitochon-
drial matrix. The generation of high-resolution live cell microscopy has further
revealed mitochondria as dynamic entities with ability to fuse and divide that enables
the formation of tubular networks, enhancing mitochondrial functioning and synergy
within the cell (Nunnari et al. 1997 ). Mitochondria are commonly referred to as the
‘powerhouse’of the cell as they are the major site for the generation of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Mitchell 1961 ).
Other important mitochondrial functions include iron-sulphur biogenesis and haem
synthesis, one carbon metabolism, fatty acid synthesis and oxidation, regulation of
calcium homeostasis, induction of apoptosis and ROS generation.

###### Oxidative Phosphorylation

An array of intricate metabolic pathways within a cell convert energy stored in
macronutrients into ATP. Conventional carbohydrate oxidation comprises a series of
metabolic pathways with shuttling of glucose into glycolysis in the cytoplasm,
followed byflux through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and OXPHOS in the
mitochondria. Glycolysis synthesises 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule,
whereas in the presence of O 2 complete oxidation in the mitochondria to CO 2 and
H 2 O, permits the synthesis of 36 ATP molecules. The OXPHOS machinery com-
prises the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), composed of protein-lipid
enzyme complexes (I–V), present as supercomplexes denoted as‘respirasomes’in
the IMM (Schagger and Pfeiffer 2000 ; Acin-Perez et al. 2008 ), and complex V, the
ATP synthase. NADH and FADH2, reduced in the TCA cycle, donate electrons to
the ETC at complexes I and II, respectively. Transfer of electrons down the ETC
yields free energy for the pumping of protons at complexes I, III and IV from the
mitochondrial matrix across the IMM to the intermembrane space. Subsequently, an
electrochemical gradient is established across the IMM providing the proton motive
force required by complex V (ATP synthase) for its rotation and conformational
change for the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Noji et al.
1997 ).

###### Mitochondrial Genetics

Human mtDNA is a double-stranded, ~16.5 Kb circular genome located within the
mitochondrial matrix (Anderson et al. 1981 ). MtDNA encodes 37 genes, 13 protein
subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the 12S and 16S ribosomal RNA
(rRNA) and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs) for mitochondrial translation (Nass 1966 ;
Anderson et al. 1981 ). The relatively small and compact mitochondrial genome is
strictly maternally inherited (Giles et al. 1980 ) and is thought to have evolved
through the loss and transfer of genes from theα-proteobacterium genome to the
nuclear DNA (Gray et al. 1999 ; Gray 1999 ). As such the remaining gene products
required by mitochondria for biogenesis, maintenance and function are nuclear
encoded and are imported into the mitochondria. Mitochondria are abundant within
most somatic cells and as such there are approximately 1000–10,000 mtDNA copies
per cell (Lightowlers et al. 1997 ). Single or multiple mtDNA molecules are
organised into compact nucleoprotein complexes, called nucleoids (Satoh and
Kuroiwa 1991 ). Thefirst reports of nucleoid composition suggested that the proteins
located within the nucleoid core included mitochondrial transcription factor A
(TFAM), mitochondrial single-strand binding protein (mtSSB), mitochondrial
DNA polymeraseγ(Polγ), mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) and the
mitochondrial TWINKLE helicase (Bogenhagen et al. 2008 ), whilst proteins
involved in RNA processing, translation and assembly of respiratory complexes


80 J. C. Whitehall et al.

were said to be found in the periphery of the nucleoid (Bogenhagen et al. 2008 ).
However, more recently, alternative models have been proposed. Using electron
microscopy, cryo-ET microscopy and super-resolution microscopy it was demon-
strated that the mitochondrial nucleoid consists of a single mtDNA molecule
compacted by cross-strand binding of approximately 1000 molecules of TFAM
per mtDNA molecule in the absence of additional proteins (Kukat et al. 2011 ,
2015 ). Furthermore, the abundance of TFAM and thus the level of DNA compaction
has been shown to impact the proportion of mtDNA molecules available for tran-
scription or replication (Farge et al. 2014 ).
Nucleoids are thought to be semi-protective; however, mutagenesis of mtDNA
resulting in deletions, point mutations, insertions or large-scale rearrangements is
seen to occur due to a range of extrinsic or intrinsic agents, and biological
malfunctioning. In comparison to the nuclear genome, the mutation rate of
mtDNA is thought to be ~17-fold higher (Wallace et al. 1987 ). It was initially
thought that the majority of mtDNA point mutations occurred following
ROS-induced mtDNA damage (Loschen et al. 1971 ). However, extensive examina-
tion of mtDNA point mutation spectra revealed a pattern more compatible with
mtDNA replication errors by the endogenously error prone Polγ(Zheng et al. 2006 ).
Whilst large-scale mtDNA deletions were originally postulated to arise during
replication via a slipped-strand mechanism (Shoffner et al. 1989 ), others have argued
that the spectrum of deletion breakpoints is more compatible with a mechanism
whereby deletions are induced following mis-repair of mtDNA double-strand breaks
(Krishnan et al. 2008 ).
The polyploid nature of mtDNA means that cells can exist in a state of
homoplasmy (all mtDNA molecules are identical) or heteroplasmy (mixed popula-
tion of mtDNA genotypes within a cell) (Taylor and Turnbull 2005 ). The majority of
mtDNA mutations are functionally recessive, and it is only when a critical threshold
of mutated mtDNA is reached and the residual wild-type mtDNA molecules are no
longer able to compensate, that a biochemical defect becomes manifest (Sciacco
et al. 1994 ). The threshold at which the biochemical defect is induced varies
depending on the mtDNA mutation type and metabolic demand of the tissue and
is clinically used as a biomarker in the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease
(Lightowlers et al. 1997 ). Adding further layers of complexity to mitochondrial
genetics, mtDNA replication, unlike the nuclear genome, is uncoupled from the cell
cycle (Bogenhagen and Clayton 1977 ). Owing to this semi-autonomous attribute and
the polyploid nature of mtDNA, the level of mtDNA mutations within a cell is not
stable. In fact, a single mutated mtDNA molecule within a cell can come to dominate
the mtDNA population within a cell over time. This process is termed clonal
expansion. The mechanism by which it occurs is still heavily debated and is likely
to be tissue type dependent (discussed below).


4 Mitochondrial DNA Mutations and Ageing 81

###### Mitochondrial DNA Mutations in Ageing

Histochemical staining of cytochromecoxidase (COX, complex IV of the ETC)
provided thefirst association between increasing age and mitochondrial dysfunction.
Early studies showed an age-related increase in the frequency of COX-deficient cells
including cardiomyocytes, skeletal musclefibres and neurons of the brain (Muller-
Hocker 1989 , 1990; Cottrell et al. 2001 ). The mosaic pattern of these COX-deficient
cells was similar to the pattern observed in patients with primary mtDNA disease,
but at a much lower frequency, indicating that mtDNA mutations may be the
underlying cause, which was subsequently confirmed (Brierley et al. 1998 ; Bender
et al. 2006 ). Similarly, in ageing mitotic tissues, COX deficiency has been reported
in the intestine, liver and stomach (Taylor et al. 2003 ; Fellous et al. 2009 ; McDonald
et al. 2008 ), establishing that age-related COX deficiency due to somatic mtDNA
mutations was also a feature of ageing mitotic tissues maintained by adult stem cells.
Interestingly, there is a clear unsolved disparity in type of mutations present in post-
mitotic tissues versus mitotic tissues with large-scale deletions detected in aged-post-
mitotic tissues, whilst mtDNA point mutations accumulate in aged-mitotic tissues.

MtDNA Deletions

MtDNA deletions encompass mtDNA molecules that have lost large segments of
their genetic material, and commonly affect the major arc of mtDNA (Samuels et al.
2004 ). Cortopassi and Arnheim ( 1990 ) werefirst to identify somatic large-scale
mtDNA deletion in ageing tissues, detecting the common 4977 nucleotide pair
deletion, mtDNA^4977 , in aged brain and heart (Cortopassi and Arnheim 1990 ).
Further groups have subsequently confirmed mtDNA deletions in the ageing brain,
heart and skeletal muscle (Corral-Debrinski et al. 1992 ; Simonetti et al. 1992 );
however, the levels of mutation in these early reports were extremely low
undermining a possible role for mtDNA mutations in ageing. Subsequently in
1998, Brierley et al. reported high levels of mtDNA deletions in individual skeletal
musclefibres with an associated biochemical defect in aged subjects (Brierley et al.
1998 ). This observation was complemented by Bender et al. ( 2006 ) who showed a
significant accumulation of mtDNA deletions in aged substantia nigra neurons.
Numerous studies have tried to identify the mechanism through which mtDNA
deletions clonally expand in individual cells during ageing (Vincent et al. 2018 ;
Krishnan etal. 2008; Campbell et al. 2014 ; Elson et al. 2001 ). This has been of
particular interest as clonally expanded mtDNA deletions have been implicated in
age-related conditions such as musclefibre atrophy, heart disease and Parkinson’s
disease (Herbst et al. 2007 ; Bender et al. 2006 ; Mohamed et al. 2006 ; Bua et al.
2006 ). Early in silico predictions supported the theory that simple random genetic
drift could explain clonal expansion of mtDNA mutations with age (Elson et al.
2001 ); however, these models do not control for diffusion of mtDNA along muscle
fibres nor from neuronal synapses to the nodes of Ranvier. Subsequently theories


82 J. C. Whitehall et al.

including a replicative advantage of mtDNA deleted molecules (Wallace 1989 ;
Fukui and Moraes 2009 ) and feedback mechanisms contributing to mtDNA repli-
cation due to low levels of mitochondrial proteins have been postulated (de Grey
1997 ). More recently, in muscle, the perinuclear niche hypothesis has been
described. The authors propose that mtDNA deletions causing respiratory chain
deficiency induce retrograde stress signalling which induces mtDNA biogenesis in
the perinuclear foci of musclefibres, resulting in further replication of those deleted
molecules. This hypothesis is supported by thefinding of respiratory chain deficient
regions of musclefibres being localised to perinuclear regions (Vincent et al. 2018 ).
In contrast, the mechanism of clonal expansion of mtDNA deletions in neurons is
thought to be predominantly mediated through mitochondrial transportation and
fission and fusion dynamics. This is supported by the observed transference of
mitochondria to sites of high energy demand or for their degradation in the soma
(Kang et al. 2008 ; Miller and Sheetz 2004 ; McWilliams et al. 2016 ). Moving
forward studies investigating driving forces of mtDNA deletions in ageing must
ensure tissue mosaicism and cytology of the different cell types are fully accounted
for before inferences can be made.

MtDNA Point Mutations

Somatic mtDNA point mutations have been detected in numerous mitotic tissues
maintained by adult stem cells (ASCs), with thefirst report being in ageing buccal
epithelium (Nekhaeva et al. 2002 ). Subsequently age-related mtDNA point muta-
tions have also been observed in the intestine, stomach, liver, oesophagus and
prostate (Taylor et al. 2003 ; McDonald et al. 2008 ; Fellous et al. 2009 ; Blackwood
et al. 2011 ). Combined histochemical and sequencing studies of single human
colonic crypts by Taylor and colleagues revealed that the mtDNA mutations were
occurring and clonally expanding within the stem cell compartment causing COX
deficiency. This resulted in ribbons of COX deficiency from the base to the lumen of
the crypts as each of the daughter cells and subsequent progenitors inherited the
mtDNA genotype of the stem cell (Taylor et al. 2003 ; Greaves et al. 2006 , 2012). As
with the mtDNA deletions discussed earlier, the mtDNA point mutations detected in
ageing mitotic tissues had occurred somatically and clonally expanded over time.
Mathematical modelling studies support the mechanism of random genetic drift
coupled with mitotic segregation at cell division to explain clonal expansion. Here
cells undergoing division amplify their mtDNA pool including mtDNA mutations,
and following segregation into daughter cells, mtDNA species can ultimately be lost
or clonally expand. This has been shown in colonic crypt stem cells (Stamp et al.
2018 ), normal buccal epithelial cells and tumour cells (Coller et al. 2001 ).
Understanding the consequences of mtDNA mutation accumulation with age has
extended beyond the impairment of oxidative phosphorylation. Indeed Nooteboom
et al. ( 2010 ) showed that complex IV deficiency resulted in a decrease in the size of
the proliferative compartment of the crypts, an increase in apoptosis and ultimately a
decreased crypt cell population. What is more, age-related mitochondrial OXPHOS


4 Mitochondrial DNA Mutations and Ageing 83

dysfunction has been exploited as a dynamic lineage tracer for stem cell fate and
homeostasis in the ageing colon (Nicholson et al. 2018 ; Stamp et al. 2018 ), and the
advent of massively parallel single-cell sequencing has highlighted the utility of
somatic mtDNA point mutations in lineage tracing in tens of thousands of cells
(Kwok et al. 2022 ). Interestingly inherited mtDNA point mutations whilst stable in
post-mitotic tissue with age, are lost with age in mitotic tissues including the colon
and blood (Su et al. 2018 ; Kwok et al. 2022 ). This suggests that different selective
pressures are at play in young versus ageing mitotic tissues.

###### Mouse Models of Mitochondrial Alterations with Ageing

Despite the plethora of evidence that mtDNA mutations occur and clonally expand
in ageing human tissues, resulting in a mosaic pattern of respiratory chain deficiency,
direct evidence of a causal role in ageing and the development of age-related disease
has been lacking. Therefore, to test this hypothesis numerous groups have used
transgenic mice as experimental models. The first mouse with tissue-specific
age-related mitochondrial dysfunction to be developed was theTfam-/-mouse
model. Tissue-specific knockout of the transcriptional activatorTfamin the pancre-
aticβ-cells (Silva et al. 2000 ) and nigrostriatal dopamine neurons (Ekstrand et al.
2007 ) resulted in a decrease in mtDNA copy number, respiratory chain dysfunction
and an associated onset of diabetes or Parkinsonism phenotype respectively. How-
ever, the effect was not universal, for example, skeletal muscle specificTfam
knockout did not result in an overt phenotype (Wredenberg et al. 2006 ), and led to
some experts questioning the general utility of theTfam-/-model in the ageingfield.
The generation of the mutator mouse model with an erroneous mitochondrial
polymerase gamma (PolγA)(Trifunovic et al. 2004 ; Kujoth et al. 2005 ) allowed
direct investigation of the effect of mtDNA mutations in ageing. An aspartate to
alanine substitution at residue 257 of the conserved proofreading domain ofPolγA
impairs the exonuclease activity of the enzyme resulting in an up to eightfold
increase in the likelihood of point mutations occurring during replication of the
mitochondrial genome. This results in a reduction in life span, and the development
of kyphosis, anaemia, greying of hair, alopecia, osteoporosis, weight loss, muscle
loss, all akin to a premature ageing phenotype. ThePolγAmut/mutmodel has not
however been free of controversies within the ageing field. Initial reports
documented an unanticipated absence of an increased ROS production by the
PolγAmutation. This was not resolved until almost a decade later when Logan
et al. ( 2014 ) applied a molecular probe to specifically targeting the mitochondria and
showed increased levels of ROS in ageingPolγAmut/muttissues. Additionalex vivo
andin vivoanalyses ofPolγAmut/mutmice have subsequently been carried out to
dissect the molecular mechanisms through which the accumulation of mtDNA
mutations leads to an ageing phenotype. Results have suggested that apoptosis
(Norddahl et al. 2011 ), inflammation (Logan et al. 2014 ) and stem cell dysfunction


84 J. C. Whitehall et al.

(Ahlqvist et al. 2012 ) are the major players in the premature ageing phenotype of the
PolγAmut/mutmice.

###### Mitochondrial Function and Stem Cell Ageing

Tight control over the self-renewal, differentiation, and regeneration of long-lived
adult stem cells (ASCs) is necessary to support homeostasis of almost all mammalian
tissues. Notably the homeostasis of ASCs relies heavily on metabolic status, ROS
signalling and the availability of specific cofactors and epigenetic modifiers, all of
which have mitochondrial involvement. In a quiescent state ASCs are often associ-
ated with a glycolytic metabolic phenotype (Simsek et al. 2010 ; Takubo et al. 2013 ;
Zheng et al. 2016 ) which upon differentiation switches to OXPHOS (Zheng et al.
2016 ; Wüst et al. 2018 ;O’Brien et al. 2015 ). Within the haematopoietic stem cell
(HCS) niche, quiescence is maintained in response to low levels of oxygen via
activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α(HIF-1α). HIF-1αrestricts the entry of
pyruvate into the TCA cycle and subsequent OXPHOS in the mitochondria by its
activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) (Takubo et al. 2013 ). The
predominance of glycolytic metabolism favours the generation of the cofactor
acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation in HSCs maintaining pluripotency (Moussaieff
et al. 2015 ), whereas OXPHOS supports the maintenance ofα-ketoglutarate (α-KG)
levels favouring demethylation of DNA and HSC differentiation (Ho et al. 2017 ).
Perturbations in this balance can have major implications on stem cell fate and have
been linked with the age-associated impairment of autophagy in murine HSCs
(Ho et al. 2017 ), and impaired glucose uptake resulting from reduced expression
of the glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) in aged pluripotent stem cells (Zhang et al.
2017 ). Both of these mechanisms may promote aberrant differentiation at the
expense of maintaining stemness.
The critical coenzyme NAD+ is intricately linked with mitochondrial metabo-
lism, participating as an essential electron transporter and as a critical catalyst for pol
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a nuclear repair enzyme, and the sirtuin family of
NAD-dependent histone deacetylases. A delicate balance in the regulation of the
NAD/NADH ratio is critical. Reductions in intracellular levels of NAD+ have been
reported with advancing age (Braidy et al. 2011 ; Massudi et al. 2012 ), and have been
shown to recapitulate phenotypes of neural stem cell ageing (Stein and Imai 2014 ).
Theseeffects are thought to be mediated through sirtuins, which have been well
documented as central metabolic nodes regulating cellular ageing and longevity.
Three of seven sirtuins are thought to be housed within mitochondria, SIRT3–5, and
their implication in stem cell regeneration and degeneration during ageing is ongo-
ing. In HSCs, SIRT3 is downregulated with increasing age and as such, its promo-
tion of antioxidant activity and ROS scavenging is impaired resulting in a reduction
in HSC pool size and in self-renewal capacity. Reversal of these effects is observed
following upregulation of SIRT3 (Brown et al. 2013 ). SIRT3 has since been shown
to help maintain cell homeostasis and co-ordinate the mitochondrial unfolded protein

response (UPRmt) that regulates antioxidant machinery and mitophagy in response to
stress (Papa and Germain 2014 ). Meanwhile SIRT7 is also linked to another axis of
the UPRmtand has been shown to decrease in expression in ageing HSCs rendering
them less capable of dealing with an age-related increased level of mitochondrial
protein folding stress (Mohrin et al. 2015 ). A premature HSC ageing phenotype with
increased apoptosis, a myeloid differentiation bias and reduced regenerative poten-
tial in SIRT7 deficient mice was subsequently rescued by SIRT7 overexpression and
linked to the repression of nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1). This reduces
mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration alleviating protein folding stress (Mohrin
et al. 2015 ). Activation of SIRT1, although its primary localisation is nuclear, is
linked to the regulation of mitochondrial function and stem cell ageing via several
mechanisms such as the promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis (Cantó et al. 2009 ),
autophagy (Huang et al. 2015 ) and the upregulation of antioxidant gene expression
(Hori et al. 2013 ).
Increased levels of ROS are also shown to lead to the activation of p38 MAPK, a
member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, which subsequently
upregulatesp 16 Ink4aandp 19 Arfin the HSC population inducing senescence and
thus limiting stem cell lifespan (Ito et al. 2006 ). In the intestine mitochondria ROS
have been shown to activate p38 MAPK and drive intestinal crypt differentiation
(Rodriguez-Colman et al. 2017 ). Subsequently He et al. ( 2020 ) implicated p38
MAPK activation in the age-related exhaustion of intestinal stem cells. In compar-
ison to young animals, aged murine intestinalLgr5+stem cells demonstrate an
increased activation of the nutrient and growth factor sensing mammalian target of
rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1). They showed thatLgr5+specific deletion of an
MTORC1 suppressor, tuberous sclerosis 1(Tsc1), induced a premature intestinal
ageing phenotype in young mice which was ameliorated with administration of the
MTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. In the absence of rapamycin,Tsc1ablation led to
mTORC1 activation, increased mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MKK6) expres-
sion, p38 MAPK activation and the enhancement of p53 expression. Subsequently
this resulted in the exhaustion of intestinal stem cells in addition to reductions in
villus size and density, which again could be rescued by p38 MAPK or p53
inhibition (He et al. 2020 ). These data further support mitochondria as regulators
of stem cell homeostasis and ageing.

MtDNA Mutations and Stem Cell Ageing

Utilising thePolγAmut/mutmouse model to investigate how age-related mtDNA
mutagenesis might be implicated in HSC ageing, Ahlqvist et al. ( 2015 ) showed
that mtDNA mutagenesis and consequential ROS signalling in immature erythro-
cytes perturb erythrocyte maturation leading to anaemia in these mice. The matura-
tion of erythrocytes involves their migration from the bone marrow into the
peripheral blood, where they enucleate and mature further within the circulation
with removal of their mitochondria and clearing of transferrin receptors. In compar-
ison to wild-type animals, 11-month-oldPolγAmut/mutmice showed an increased


86 J. C. Whitehall et al.

frequency of reticulocytes, immature erythrocytes, with significantly elevated mito-
chondrial retention. The mitophagy marker NIX indicated that the active removal of
mitochondria was also significantly reduced inPolγAmut/mutreticulocytes. The trans-
ferrin receptor (TfR) was also found to be abnormally retained withinPolγAmut/mut
reticulocytes, causing increased loading of free iron within these cells. As free iron is
highly reactive with oxygen, ROS are generated in reticulocytes in which both TfR
and mitochondria are retained. Cell surface proteins which are normally appropriated
to the inner cell membrane as erythrocytes mature, remain on the surface due to
oxidative damage to the enzymes that facilitate their segregation. These cell surface
proteins label the erythrocytes for premature destruction by splenic macrophages, as
indicated by significantly increased levels of iron loaded activated macrophages
within the spleen ofPolγAmut/mutmice (Ahlqvist et al. 2015 ).
Intestinal crypts ofPolγAmut/mutmice have been shown to rewire their metabolism
in response to complex I deficiency, which promotes cellular biomass and antioxi-
dant production (Smith et al. 2020 ). WhenPolγAmut/mutmice were crossed with an
inducible mouse model of intestinal cancer (Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-creERT2; Apcflox/
flox), transformed cells hijacked these growth promoting pathways, increasing the

tumour growth rate and ultimately reducing the lifespan of these mice in comparison
to controls (Smith et al. 2020 ). Following this, Stamp et al. ( 2021 ) showed that
complex I deficiency in theLgr5+intestinal stem cells ofPolγA+/mutmice increases
the rate of stem cycle re-entry. In humans several cancers including kidney, colo-
rectal and thyroid cancer, mtDNA mutations have been documented to be enriched
indicating oncogenic roles (Yuan et al. 2020 ). Taken together these studies suggest
that mtDNA mutations may enhance the development of pathologies associated with
advancing age such as cancer. The understanding of age-related mitochondrial
changes at the stem cell level, particularly those that are targetable may therefore
assist in the development of therapeutics with the aim of rejuvenating stem cell
function and thus ameliorating the disorders their functional decline may promote.

###### Mitochondrial Regulation of the Ageing Immune System

The immune system encompasses a complex stress response network tofight and
protect against disease aiding our survival. A dynamic balance between pro- and
anti-inflammatory networks is crucial for a beneficial response. However, it is well
documented that with age a low-grade, chronically activated innate immune system
known as‘inflamm-ageing’and an ultimate decline in the adaptive immune system,
termed immunosenescence can arise (Franceschi et al. 2000 ; Xia et al. 2016 ). This
has been evidenced through meta-analysis highlighting an augmented presence of
circulating inflammatory mediators e.g. IL-6 (Soysal et al. 2016 ), alongside a
paradoxical dampened response to cytokine levels due to a chronic activation of
the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
pathway in immune cells (Shen-Orr et al. 2016 ). The onset of chronic systemic
inflammation with age has subsequently been linked to disease including


4 Mitochondrial DNA Mutations and Ageing 87

osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, Parkinson’s disease, cancer, type II
diabetes, amongst others. Partially due to their prokaryotic origin, mitochondria are
seen to play an active role in the immune system and are proposed to partially
mediate the decline in immunity with age and related pathologies.
The innate immune system recognises a range of ligands with repetitive molec-
ular signatures through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the cell surface
e.g. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), or intracellular compartments e.g. the cytosolic
DNA sensors cGAS and STING. Ligands deemed as foreign to the innate immune
system can be grouped into pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or
damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Microorganism constituents
encompass PAMPs which are sensed by the innate immune cells presenting PRRs
on their surface. DAMPs comprise an array of endogenous cellular components
which are released upon cell stress, senescence, apoptosis or necrosis. Mitochondria
present a select array of potent DAMP agents, e.g. mtDNA, cardiolipin, n-formyl
peptides e.g. fMet, TFAM, ATP, and ROS. Intracellularly, mitochondrial DAMPs
can either activate the cytosolic DNA sensors cGAS and STING pathway (cGAS-
STING) evolved for recognition of single-stranded viral DNA, or the inflammasome
to induce an inflammatory response. Inflammasomes are an assembly of multiprotein
platforms in the cytosol that promotes the activation of caspase-1 to induce cytokine
production and cell death (Vanaja et al. 2015 ). A variety of inflammasome types
exist, with the NLRP3 inflammasome being the most well studied and shown to be
activated by oxidised mtDNA (Shimada et al. 2012 ).
The stimulation of the innate immune system by bacterial N-formylated proteins
and bacteria DNA is initiated by the extracellular release of mtDNA and the
N-formyl peptide which are sensed by TLR9, and formyl peptide receptors respec-
tively. The significance of these mitochondrial DAMPs as circulating elicitors of the
immune response is seen during trauma (Zhang et al. 2010 ) and heart failure (Oka
et al. 2012 ). Moreover, circulating mtDNA levels are documented to increase with
age, alongside a correlative increase in levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α,
IL-6, and IL-1ra (Pinti et al. 2014 ). Conversely however, a reduction in the circu-
lating mtDNA copy number is observed in neurodegenerative disease (Pyle et al.
2016 ; Podlesniy et al. 2013 ). Pyle et al. ( 2016 ) showed that Parkinson’s disease
patients had a lower level of circulating mtDNA compared with age-matched
controls, which coincides with reduced mtDNA levels also seen in the substantia
nigra pars compacta tissue of these patients. Subsequently the application of circu-
lating mtDNA as a biomarker in the aetiology of Parkinson’s disease has been
proposed, with recent advancements showing that therapeutic treatment can influ-
ence circulating mtDNA levels (Lowes et al. 2020 ). Furthermore circulating mtDNA
has been suggested as a biomarker of neurocognitive impairment and
neurodegeneration linked to HIV (Pérez-Santiago et al. 2017 ) and as a biomarker
in many types of tumours including breast and ovarian (Kohler et al. 2009 ; Zachariah
et al. 2008 ).
Another closely linked route of mitochondrial dysfunction driving chronic
inflammation during ageing is through the senescence associated secretory pheno-
type (SASP). Senescent cells accumulate with age (Waaijer et al. 2012 ) and


88 J. C. Whitehall et al.

contribute to a number of different age-related diseases including diabetes and
osteoporosis, with their clearance being shown to alleviate these pathologies
(Xu et al. 2015 ; Farr et al. 2017 ). Along with pro-inflammatory cytokines and
growth factors the SASP produces mitochondrial ROS to fortify cell cycle arrest
to signal to the immune system for their removal whilst inadvertently initiating
senescence in neighbouring cells (Passos et al. 2010 ; Nelson et al. 2012 ). Mitochon-
drial dysfunction is a key feature of cellular senescence (Passos et al. 2007 , 2010),
which has been associated with the NLRP3 inflammasome via ROS signalling (Yin
et al. 2017 ) and mediation of the SASP through the cGAS-STING pathway via
recognition of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments including mtDNA (Dou et al. 2017 ;
West et al. 2015 ). Recently, thePolγmut/mutmice have been shown to exhibit a
rewiring of the innate immune system with a hyperinflammatory innate immune
status driven by mtDNA instability triggering the cGAS-STING pathway for IFN-I
priming and repression of the anti-inflammatory transcription factor NRF2 (Lei et al.
2021 ). The ablation of IFN-1 in these mice improved the health span and conse-
quently strengthened the evidence that age-related mtDNA dysfunction can induce a
pro-inflammatory state in ageing.
Along with mitochondrial DAMPs contributing to the senescent phenotype,
mitochondrial metabolites e.g. low NAD+/NADH (Lee et al. 2012 ) and mitochon-
drial quality control mechanisms (Manzella et al. 2018 ; Hoshino et al. 2013 ) have
also been suggested to be involved in the regulation of senescence. Desdín-Micó
et al. ( 2020 ) showed in mice that whenTfamwas knocked out in T cells, this resulted
in the generation of an inflammageing phenotype that caused systemic senescence
and premature ageing. Supplementing these mice with nicotinamide riboside, the
NAD+ precursor, could partially rescue the age deterioration seen in theTfam
deficient Tcells. These data show that mitochondria may regulate senescence during
ageing via numerous molecular mechanisms and suggest that targeting these path-
ways may help to ameliorate age-related morbidities.

###### Targeting Mitochondria in Ageing

Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction to improve the treatment of age-related disease
and ultimately the health span of the older population is an area of ongoing research.
A range of aspects of mitochondrial physiology including mitochondrial dynamics,
metabolism, ROS production, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitophagy have been
explored as targets. Multiple studies have hypothesised that these mitochondrial
functions may be regulated through lifestyle interventions, as well as through
pharmaceutical compounds. Dietary restriction (Weindruch 1996 ) and exercise
(Lee and Paffenbarger 2000 ) are the two most long-standing non-pharmacologic
interventions that have provided evidence for improvement in the lifespan and heath
span of biological systems. Rejuvenation of the ageing process through dietary
restriction and exercise are thought to centre on evolutionary conserved metabolic
sensory pathways encompassing mTOR, AMPK and sirtuins (reviewed in (Stanfel


4 Mitochondrial DNA Mutations and Ageing 89

et al. 2009 ; Ruetenik and Barrientos 2015 )). Studies to investigate the molecular
mechanisms through which dietary restriction and exercise are able to mediate life
and health span have suggested that enhancement of mitochondrial function is a
major player. This is predominantly through the transcription co-activator peroxi-
some proliferator-activated receptor-gamma 1(PGC1α) which controls mitochon-
drial biogenesis. However, many studies directly manipulating PGC1αto enhance
mitochondrial biogenesis have generated conflicting results. For example, in one
study, PGC1αwas shown to induce the switching of musclefibre types from fast-
twitching glycolyticfibres to slow-twitching oxidativefibres with a high concentra-
tion of mitochondria (Lin et al. 2002 ). Conversely, in muscle-specific PGC1α
knockout mice, Rowe et al. ( 2012 ) demonstrated that PGC1αwas dispensable for
exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. Furthermore when Dillon et al. ( 2012 )
targeted PGC1αto increase mitobiogenesis in the muscle ofPolγmut/mutmice, they
observed improved heart and skeletal muscle heart function but also a paradoxical
increase in mtDNA mutation burden.
Consistent with the MFRTA considerable efforts have been made to ameliorate
oxidative stress by targeting ROS formation or increasing antioxidant defence
systems with synthetic or naturally occurring compounds, in a bid to promote health
span (Ishii et al. 2004 ; Parkes et al. 1998 ; Melov et al. 1999 ). Notably, the
application of mitochondrial targeted antioxidant treatments has shown more con-
sistent and beneficial evidence for their potential use in reducing oxidative stress in
mitochondria than non-targeted in therapy (Jauslin et al. 2003 ; Kelso et al. 2001 ).
However, many studies targeting oxidative stress have failed to show improved
health benefits, with many showing no health benefits or on the contrary high ROS
levels to be life promoting (Lee et al. 2010 ), and antioxidants to be disease-
promoting (Myung et al. 2010 ; Bjelakovic et al. 2004 ). Subsequently‘mitohormesis’
first coined by Ristow and Zarse ( 2010 ), conceptualised the theory that by inducing a
mild level of mitochondrial stress, an increase in mitochondrial metabolism and
increased stress resistance develop, conferring an adaptive response to oxidative
stress and improving health span. Whilst at high levels such stressors can be
ultimately damaging, low levels cause transient increases in ROS that activate
genes involved in cellular stress response mechanisms. Thus, mitohormesis some-
what contradicts the MFRTA, and suggests a beneficial role of ROS in healthy
ageing. Furthermore, Flockhart et al. ( 2021 ) have recently shown that excess exer-
cise causes mitochondrial impairment stressing the existence of a delicate homeo-
static balance regulating mitochondrial function.
Other avenues, including the selective clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria
(Sterky Fredrik et al. 2011 ) and post-translational modification of mitochondria
(Stram and Payne 2016 ), have also been explored as routes to improve mitochondrial
function to lessen age-related dysfunction and associated pathologies. However,
these studies further highlight the many uncertainties surrounding the mechanisms
of mitochondrial physiology in ageing and age-related disease and stipulate further
delineation of the molecular pathways involved in improving mitochondrialfitness
and homeostasis for development of therapeutics in ageing and age-related disease.

###### Concluding Remarks

Ageing and age-related disease present an extremely intertwined network of pro-
cesses and states that may or may not be reversible. It is clear that mtDNA
mutagenesis and dysfunction is a prominent feature in the ageing process and in
multiple age-related diseases; however, unravelling causal relationships and under-
lying mechanisms remains a difficult task particularly due to the complexities of
mitochondrial genetics and their diverse cellular functions. There is growing evi-
dence suggesting the potential both for therapeutically targeting mitochondria, and
its use as a biomarker in disease. The use of new, highly sensitive single-cell
technologies may aid in revealing the importance of mtDNA mutations and func-
tional consequences in the aetiology of ageing and age-related disease, and the
potential for the development of interventions. The implication that somatic
mtDNA mutations which occur early in life may have the greatest impact in later
life (Elson et al. 2001 ; Stamp et al. 2018 ) suggests that life-long lifestyle choices for
beneficial mitochondrial health andfitness may lead to a better health span during
ageing.

#### The Proteasome and Ageing

Ashok N. Hegde, Lindsey M. Duke, Logan E. Timm, and Hannah Nobles

Abstract The proteasome is a multi-subunit proteolytic complex that functions to
degrade normal proteins for physiological regulation and to eliminate abnormal
proteins for cellular protection. Generally, the proteasome targets substrate proteins
that are marked by attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules. In various types of
cells in an organism, damage to proteins occurs both from internal sources such as
reactive oxygen species and from external ones such as UV radiation from the sun.
The proteasome functions to protect the cells by degrading damaged proteins. With
ageing, however, the capacity of the proteasome to degrade damaged proteins is
reduced as indicated by evidence gathered by many studies. Studies on ageing in
muscle, skin, and brain show that with age catalytic activity of the proteasome is
decreased and the expression of proteasome subunits is altered. Age-related accu-
mulation of damaged or misfolded proteins causes further reduction of proteasome
activity. Abnormal proteins also accumulate as a result of age-related neurodegen-
erative diseases. Deficits in proteasome activity might be responsible for accumula-
tion of protein aggregates and thus contribute to the pathology. Results from several
studies suggest a link between the proteasome and longevity. This chapter reviews
the various ways in which the proteasome is associated with the ageing process and
examines evidence gathered from investigations on cultured cells, model organisms,
and humans.

###### Introduction

Ageing is a complex process to which many genetic and environmental factors
contribute. It is thought that accumulated damage to the genome as well as the
proteome causes age-related structural deterioration and functional decline at the
cellular and organismal levels. A key contributor to the maintenance of a healthy
proteome is a proteolytic complex called the proteasome which functions physio-
logically to degrade ubiquitin-tagged proteins. It also has an important role in
degradation of abnormal proteins. At the cellular level, protein degradation is the
yang to the yin of protein synthesis and the two systems together maintain the
proteome. This exquisitely maintained balance of cellular proteins slowly becomes
unstable with ageing and might occasionally collapse when an organism succumbs
to disease. The functional connection of the proteasome with ageing is perhaps best
understood in the context of physiology as well as pathology. Here we review
the evidence for the role of the proteasome in normal ageing in different parts of
the body as well as in age-related neurodegenerative diseases. We also examine the
literature linking the proteasome to longevity and possible ways of activating the
proteasome to promote healthy ageing.

###### The Proteasome: A Brief Overview

The proteasome consists of a 20S catalytic core and two 19S regulatory caps

interferon-γ.This type of proteasome has a slightly different catalytic activity in

100 A. N. Hegde et al.

attached on either side of thecylindrical core, and is termed the 26S proteasome
(Fig.5.1). The 19S regulatory cap is also known as PA700 based on its molecular
mass (700 KDa). The 20S proteasome can be modulated by alternative regulatory
complexes called PA200, PA28, or 11S (Hegde 2004 ).
The catalytic core has two types of subunitsαandβ. There are sevenαsubunits
(α 1 – α7) and sevenβsubunits (β 1 – β7) and these are arranged in four stacked rings
with inner rings comprising two sets ofβsubunits and the outer rings consisting of
one set ofαsubunits. The catalytic activity of the 20S is conferred by a threonine
residue in the N-terminus of theβsubunitsβ1,β2, andβ5. Enzymatically the
proteasome possesses three types of activities, namely chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-
like, post-glutamyl peptidase. These activities cleave after hydrophobic, basic, and
acidic residues, respectively (Fig.5.1).
The 19S regulatory cap has a base and a lid. The base consists of six ATPase
subunits (Rpt1–Rpt6) and two non-ATPase subunits (Rpn1, Rpn2, and Rpn13). The
lid comprises 10 non-ATPase subunits (Rpn2, Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn7, Rpn8, Rpn9,
Rpn10, Rpn11, Rpn12, and Rpn15) (Tanaka 2009 ).
Alternative forms of the 20S proteasome are formed under certain conditions. In
immune cells, theβ1,β2, andβ5 of the catalytic core are replaced with LMP2 (β1i),
MECEL-1 (β1i), and LMP7 (β5i) which are typically induced by the cytokine


Cellular senescence was originally described as permanent replicative arrest.
Research carried out in the past several years has broadened our understanding

Fig. 5.1 Structure of the proteasome. The proteasome consists of the 20S core and the 19S cap. The
20S proteasome contains the catalytic sites and comprises four stacked rings. The inner two rings
have sevenβsubunits (β 1 – β7) and the outer rings have sevenαsubunits (α 1 – α7). The 19S
regulatory cap is made of base and a lid each with eight subunits. Two 19S regulatory caps are
attached on either side of the 20S catalytic core and together they constitute the 26S proteasome.

that the chymotrypsin-like activity ofβ5i is higher than that ofβ5 and therefore the
immunoproteasome cleaves peptides with C-terminal hydrophobic residues of anti-
genic peptides more efficiently. This alternative form of proteasome is called“the
immunoproteasome.”In non-immune cells, the immunoproteasome is induced by
proinflammatory cytokines (Murata et al. 2018 ).
The 26S proteasome degrades proteins marked with polyubiquitin chains in
which ubiquitin molecules are linked to each other through their 48th lysine resi-
dues. The 20S proteasome can exist as part of the 26S proteasome as well as an
independent proteolytic entity (Hegde 2004 ).

###### Cellular Senescence and the Proteasome

and currently cellular senescenceis thought to be a response to a multitude of
stressors. A variety of internal stimuli such as oxidative stress and mitochondrial
dysfunction and external stimuli such as irradiation and exposure to toxic chemicals
can accelerate cellular senescence. As cells age, accumulated protein damage can
overburden the clearing systems such as the lysosome or the proteasome. Coupled


With ageing, progressive loss of muscle function occurs often accompanied by loss
of muscle mass. Experiments on mammalian model systems investigated the

with this, overall proteolytic ability of cells might be reduced with ageing (Sabath
et al. 2020 ).
In various model organisms, a link between the proteasome and ageing has been
shown. For example,fission yeast has a long lifespan in quiescence upon nitrogen
starvation. In this model, proteasome inactivation causes accumulation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysfunction. Under these conditions,
mitochondria are consumed by autophagy which is believed to be a defensive
mechanism against harmful accumulation of ROS (Takeda and Yanagida 2010 ). A
role for the proteasome in degrading oxidatively damaged proteins has also been
shown in higher organisms. For example, in the mouse hippocampal HT22 cell line,
Hsp70 promotes the action of the proteasome in degrading proteins damaged by
treatment of the HT22 cells with hydrogen peroxide (Reeg et al. 2016 ).

###### Muscle Ageing and the Proteasome

changes in the function of the muscleproteasome with ageing.
Studies on the LOU rat (an inbred strain derived from Wistar rats) focused on the
three types of proteolytic functions of the 20S proteasome, namely chymotrypsin-
like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl peptidase activities. The researchers inves-
tigated these activities in the gastrocnemius medialis muscle in rats of 4, 18, 24, 29,
and 34 months of age. They found that the three proteolytic activities of the 20S
proteasome increased up to 29 months and decreased in the 34-month-old rats
(Bardag-Gorce et al. 1999 ).
Investigation on the role of the proteasome on muscle atrophy with ageing
compared Type I or slow-twitch musclefibers from F344BN rats. The study found
a threefold increase in the 20S catalytic core of the proteasome with ageing but the
catalytic activity of the 20S proteasome remained the same, leading to the conclusion
that specific activity of the proteasome reduced with ageing (Husom et al. 2004 ).
A study on fast-twitch muscle of F344BN rats found a two-to-threefold decrease
in the content of the 20S proteasome as well as 75% reduction in two regulatory
complexes PA700 and PA28. These authors also found an increase in two cytokine-
inducible subunits of the immunoproteasome called LMP2 and LMP7. Degradation
of a test substrate, oxidized calmodulin, was faster in the muscle from young animals
compared to that in the muscle from aged animals (Ferrington et al. 2005 ).
Muscle mass and integrity is maintained in adults through regeneration from
muscle stem cells (also called satellite cells). The proteasome appears to be required
for function of muscle stem cells. When a component of the 19S proteasome called
Rpt3 (which is one of the six ATPases in the base of the 19S regulatory cap), this
study tested regeneration of tibialis anterior muscle in C57BL/6J mice after
cardiotoxin-induced injury. When Rpt3 was knocked out specifically in satellite
cells, muscle regeneration was impaired compared to control mice. This study also


Several investigations have explored the connection between skin ageing and the
proteasome.

5 The Proteasome and Ageing 103

showed that regeneration is accompanied by an increase in chymotrypsin-like and
trypsin-like activities of the proteasome. Blockade of muscle regeneration in Rpt3
deficient mice is linked to stabilization of p53 which prevents cell proliferation and
results in cell death. This investigation found that when p53 was knocked down in
Rpt3-deficient myoblasts, proliferation of those cells was restored (Kitajima et al.
2018 ).

###### Skin Ageing and the Proteasome

A study carried out on human dermalfibroblasts showed a significant decrease in
all three catalytic activities (chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl
peptidase) of the 20S proteasome infibroblasts from 50-year-old individuals com-
pared to those from 20-year-old persons. The same study also used immunoblotting
to measure the levels of proteasome catalytic subunits as well as some 19S regula-
tory subunits. The experiments revealed a decrease in twoβsubunits (β1 andβ5) and
two 19S subunits (Rpt3, Rpn12) infibroblasts from older individuals compared to
those from younger ones. Additional experiments to measure the levels of mRNAs
of proteasome subunits using quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) showed a signif-
icant decrease inβ1,β5,β7 mRNAs infibroblasts from older individuals relative to
those from younger ones. The Q-PCR experiments also found that levels of Rpt1
mRNA were sixfold higher infibroblasts from younger individuals compared to
those from older people (Hwang et al. 2007 ).
Experiments on epidermal cells obtained from healthy donors undergoing plastic
surgery procedures (mammary gland reductions) measured the content of carbonyl
derivatives as a proxy for oxidized proteins. The epidermal samples came from
young (17, 20, and 25 years old), middle-aged (39 and 42 years), and older (50, 60,
and 67 years old) donors. The results showed an increase in oxidized proteins in
older individuals compared to the young donors. Assays on other types of protein
damage showed an increase in lipid peroxidation and glycation with advanced age.
This study also found a decrease in chymotrypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl pepti-
dase activities of the 20S proteasome. The researchers also tested the quantity of 20S
proteasome by immunoblotting and found 10% and 60% reduction in some of the
20S subunits in keratinocytes from 50-year-old and 67-year-old donors, compared to
the keratinocytes from a 17-year-old donor. In addition, enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay provided supporting evidence for reduction of proteasome content in
epidermal cells of older individuals compared to the younger ones (Petropoulos et al.
2000 ).
One of the causes of skin ageing is excessive exposure to sunlight which is termed
photo ageing. This type skin ageing mainly occurs because of the ultraviolet
(UV) radiation coming from sunlight. UV-induced ageing is often studied using
exposure of cultured skinfibroblasts to specific types of UV radiation. In a study


104 A. N. Hegde et al.

Fig. 5.2 Schematic diagram showing the role of the proteasome in ageing. When a soluble protein
(top left) is exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) or other damaging agents (such as UV
radiation), it forms aggregates. Functionally fully active proteasome will degrade the damaged/
aggregated proteins which slows down ageing and increase the lifespan. If the proteasome is less
active, it fails to degrade the aggregated proteins triggering autophagy and other cellular programs
(such as development of secretory phenotype) which leads to cellular senescence. If autophagy or
other cellular clearance mechanisms (such as lysosomal degradation) fail, it would cause cellular
degeneration.

using exposure of human dermalfibroblasts to UVB (280–315 nm wavelength)
irradiation, researchers found that irradiation decreased proteasome activity as
measured by stabilization of a substrate fused to greenfluorescent protein. The
same study also found that when proteasome activity was inhibited, formation of
autophagosomes increased. Autophagy appears to be essential for cellular senes-
cence induced by UVB exposure. If autophagy is inhibited, dermalfibroblasts
undergo apoptosis. Therefore, it is likely that early events upon UVB exposure
such as formation of reactive oxygen species cause inactivation of the proteasome
which in turn causes an increase in autophagy, thus triggering senescence (Fig.5.2)
(Cavinato et al. 2017 ).
A study looked into the relationship between mitochondria and the proteasome in
dermalfibroblasts. Mitochondria are believed to play a key role in the ageing process
because they produce reactive oxygen species which cause mutations, damage
protein, lipids and other molecules in cells. The proteasome is linked to the ageing
process because of its role in degradation of oxidized proteins. The experiments used
dermalfibroblasts obtained from healthy young (23–29 years old), middle-aged, and
old donors. This study usedfibroblasts obtained from a biobank enriched for
longevity. Thefibroblasts derived from 90-year-old subjects were designated“old”
and thefibroblasts from skin biopsies of offspring enriched for familial longevity
and their partners (60±8 years) were considered“middle-aged.”The results showed
a decrease in proteasome activity in skinfibroblast of middle-aged donors compared
to those from young donors, but proteasome activity did not decline further in
fibroblasts from“old”donors. The experiments also found a significant decrease


Research on various model systems has discovered a link between the proteasome
and brain ageing.

5 The Proteasome and Ageing 105

in mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in the production of reactive
oxygen species. Additional studies indicated that proteasome inhibition caused a
decrease in mitochondrial function (Koziełet al. 2011 ). A caveat for the observation
on interdependence between activities of the proteasome and mitochondria is that the
study used N-acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-norleucinal to inhibit the proteasome. This
chemical is not a highly specific proteasome inhibitor and is known to inhibit other
proteases such as calpain (Hughes et al. 1996 ).

###### Brain Ageing and the Proteasome

Experiments carried out on Wistarrats and C57/BL6 mice showed a decrease at
15 months of age (compared to 6-week-old animals) in overall proteasome activity
in several regions of the brain including cortex, cerebellum, globus pallidus,
substantia nigra, and the cerebellum. In the frontal cortex chymotrypsin-like activity
was 41% and 37% lower in aged rats and mice, respectively. The chymotrypsin-like
activity was also reduced in all the brain regions tested except cerebellum. These
authors also observed a significant decrease in trypsin-like activity in substantia
nigra and the cerebellum and a substantial reduction in peptidylglutamyl peptidase
activity in substantia nigra (Zeng et al. 2005 ).
Based on research in several model organisms and on human cells, a general view
of brain ageing is that, with age, protein degradation slows down causing accumu-
lation of misfolded proteins in neurons. This in turn is likely to cause further decline
in proteolytic activity (Fig.5.2). A study carried out using a short-lived vertebrate
Nothobranchius furzeri(killifish) sought to make a quantitative assessment of
protein homeostasis by combining transcriptomics with proteomics. Thesefish
have a median life span of 3–7 months which allowed researchers to test the effect
of ageing in a short period. The experiments included sexually mature youngfish
(5 weeks post-hatching), adultfish (12 weeks post-hatching), and oldfish (39 weeks
post-hatching). The researchers determined transcripts using RNA-Seq and amounts
of proteins using an algorithm called iBAQ (intensity-based absolute quantification)
(Schwanhäusser et al. 2011 ). The results showed progressive decrease in correlation
between amounts of transcripts and proteins. One of the consequences of this
decoupling between RNA transcripts and proteins is the deterioration of ribosome
structure because of loss of stoichiometry which occurred because 13 ribosomal
proteins increased in abundance with age whereas 14 of them decreased. Other
experiments showed that ribosomal proteins are enriched in age-dependent protein
aggregates.
These authors then tested effects of ageing on the proteasome. They observed a
decrease in both transcripts and proteins of proteasome subunits which led to altered
stoichiometry between the 19S subunits and 20S subunits. With age, there was an
increase in 20S subunits relative to 26S subunits. The results also showed


Activity of the proteasome is known to be impaired in Parkinson’s disease (PD). A
key protein linked to PD isα-synuclein. Even though some studies have shown that
α-synuclein is a substrate for degradation by the proteasome (Bennett et al. 1999 ),

inhibited the degradation of a test substrate fused to greenfluorescent protein

downregulation of ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and ubiquitin ligases. Experi-
ments to test whether partially blocking proteasome activity induces age-related
phenotype used Bortezomib to achieve about 50% reduction in proteasome activity
in the brains of killifish. Protein-abundance profile after this treatment was similar to
that observed in the ageing phenotype including alterations in the large subunits of
the cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosome. The investigations also tested whether a
decrease in the proteasome in early life has an effect on the lifespan of killifish.
When RNA-seq data from biopsies of 159fish at 10 weeks and 20 weeks of age were
tested in relation to lifespan, the results showed that a decrease in expression of
proteasomal transcripts was correlated with an increased risk of mortality. Moreover,
individualfish exhibiting largest reduction in transcripts encoding the subunits of the
proteasome had shorter lifespan compared to those with largest upregulation of
proteasomal transcripts (Kelmer Sacramento et al. 2020 ).

###### Proteasome and Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases

some other studies have shown that aggregatedα-synuclein impairs the activity of
the proteasome. In PC12 cells stably expressing mutantα-synuclein, oligomers of
α-synuclein bind to the 26S proteasome and decrease the chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-
like, and peptidylglutamyl peptidase activities. Treatments that disrupt oligomeriza-
tion ofα-synuclein reduce its inhibitory effect on the activity of the proteasome.
Furthermore, the experiments showed that the proteasome is capable of degrading
α-synuclein oligomers (Emmanouilidou et al. 2010 ).
A link between the proteasome and PD pathology is also supported by investi-
gation on cultured rat mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. When the proteasome
activity is inhibited in these neurons by application of a selective inhibitor
lactacystin, proteins accumulate in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that stain positively
forα-synuclein and ubiquitin. In addition, with application of increasing concentra-
tion of lactacystin a proportionate increase in degeneration of dopaminergic neurons
occurred (McNaught et al. 2002 ).
Degradation by the proteasome is linked to the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) as well. Several studies have provided evidence for association of the
proteasome with the two main pathological mechanisms of AD, namely, accumula-
tion of amyloidβ(Aβ) leading to plaque formation and hyperphosphorylation of tau
resulting in neurofibrillary tangles.
With respect to the link between Aβand the proteasome, there are conflicting
reports as to whether the Aβ(1-42)peptide inhibits the proteasome or it is a substrate
for the proteasome. One of the earlyin vitrostudies showed that Aβ(1-40)inhibits the
chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome. In cultured neurons, Aβ(1-42)


Given the association of proteasome function with ageing, it is reasonable to
hypothesize that proteasome function is linked to longevity. Some studies have
tested this idea. For example, using theC. elegansmodel system, researchers tested

5 The Proteasome and Ageing 107

(Oh et al. 2005 ). Other studies using mouse models of AD showed inhibition of
activity of the proteasome in single transgenic mice (Tg2576) as well as triple
transgenic mice (PS1M146V, APPSwe, and tauP301L) (Almeida et al. 2006 ; Tseng
et al. 2008 ). In contrast, some other investigations have found evidence to support
the idea that the proteasome degrades the Aβpeptide. For example,in vitrostudies
showed that human 20S proteasome is capable of degrading Aβ(1-42)peptide. The
same researchers also showed that oligomers of Aβ(1-42)inhibit the proteasome.
They propose that monomeric Aβ(1-42)is a substrate for the proteasome and inhibi-
tion of the proteasome by Aβ(1-42)comes about by excessive accumulation of the
oligomeric species of the Aβpeptide (Zhao and Yang 2010 ).
Tau is a substrate for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the
proteasome. A ubiquitin ligase called CHIP (C-terminus of Hsc-70 Interacting
Protein) attaches ubiquitin molecules to tau. This is facilitated by interaction of
CHIP with Hsp70 (Dickey et al. 2008 ).

###### Proteasome and Longevity

the idea that forcing an organism to shift the metabolic resources away from
maintenance of reproductive tissues to somatic ones is likely to extend the lifespan.
They found thatglp-1mutants which are germ-line deficient showed a sixfold
increase in proteasome activity. These worms had increased lifespan and elevated
expression of the proteasome subunit Rpn6, part of the lid of the 19S regulatory cap.
Knockdown of Rpn6 using RNAi significantly reduced the lifespan of worms. In
addition, overexpression of Rpn6 in wildtype worms conferred resistance to
proteotoxic stress imposed by oxidative damage, heat shock, or UV damage.
Overexpression of Rpn6 increased the lifespan of worms at 25°C but not under
20 °C. Because 25°C causes mild heat stress in worms, it appears that Rpn6
promotes the survival of worms under physiologically stressful conditions (Vilchez
et al. 2012 ).
Evidence for a role of the proteasome in longevity has also come from investi-
gations on theDrosophilamodel. Whenβ5, a subunit of the catalytic core of the
proteasome is overexpressed in neurons, it prevented age-related decline in learning
and memory as measured by aversion to certain natural odors paired with mild
electrical shock. Theflies overexpressingβ5 also had increased lifespan (Munkácsy
et al. 2019 ).
In addition to the components of the proteasome that have been linked to
longevity through experimentation, it is likely many other molecules that are part
of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) have a role in determining longevity.
For example, a study analyzing proteins in mammals that are targets for selection


The evidence from several studies indicates that proteasome activity declines with
ageing which suggests that activating the proteasome might work to slow down the

108 A. N. Hegde et al.

when longevity evolves, found that genes encoding the components of the UPP are
under selection in lineages where longevity increased (Li and de Magalhães 2013 ).

###### Other Components of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway

###### Implicated in Ageing

The 26S proteasome degrades proteins marked by attachment of polyubiquitin
chains. Therefore, a brief survey of molecules that participate in ubiquitin attachment
and their role in ageing is in order. Specifically, we consider the role of the UPP in
regulating insulin receptor signaling which is linked to ageing (Kenyon 2010 ).
Insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) bindto the receptor and activate a
signaling cascade which leads to inactivation of the forkhead box (FOXO) tran-
scription factor, which reduces the lifespan. Any modulation of the signaling cascade
from the insulin receptor that dampens the signaling and thus prevents inactivation
of the FOXO will lead to transcription of longevity-promoting genes by FOXO.
Many components of insulin receptor signaling cascade are regulated by
ubiquitin ligases. For example, the ubiquitin ligase CHIP targets the insulin receptor
and marks it by monoubiquitination for endocytosis and lysosomal degradation, thus
regulating the availability of the receptor on the plasma membrane. A kinase called
AKT that is part of this signaling is also a substrate for CHIP which
polyubiquitinates AKT for degradation by the proteasome (Su et al. 2011 ). In
C. elegans, the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 is a substrate for a ubiquitin
ligase called RLE-1 and proteasome-mediated degradation. Loss of function of
RLE-1 increases the lifespan of worms (Li et al. 2007 ).

###### Activating the Proteasome to Decelerate the Ageing Process

ageing process (Fig.5.2). Investigations oncell lines and model organisms have
attempted to test this idea. Research on human embryonicfibroblast cell line WI3T/T
and promyeloblast cell line HL60 showed that stable overexpression ofβ5 subunit of
the 20S proteasome caused an increase in all three catalytic activities. When treated
with different oxidants, the cells overexpressingβ5 subunit showed higher survival
rates compared to controls. In addition, the cells overexpressingβ5 subunit showed
increased number of population doublings compared to controls cells, indicating that
increased activity of the proteasome delayed senescence (Chondrogianni et al.
2005 ).
Investigation on theC. elegansmodel also employed manipulation of a core
subunit of the proteasome calledpbs-5(an ortholog of the humanβ5 subunit). The


5 The Proteasome and Ageing 109

worms overexpressingpbs-5showed increased amounts of bothαandβsubunits of
the 20S proteasome core. The increase in proteasome content was accompanied by
an increase in chymotrypsin-like activity. Overexpression ofpbs-5also led to a
significant increase in the lifespan of worms (Chondrogianni et al. 2015 ).
InDrosophila, activation of the 26S proteasome through a gain-of-function
mutation of Rpn11 (a subunit of the 19S lid) suppressed the age-related reduction
in proteasome activity and decreased accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins.
Moreover, Rpn11 overexpression suppressed expanded polyglutamine-induced pro-
gressive neurodegeneration and prolonged the lifespan offlies (Tonoki et al. 2009 ).
Experiments on outbred mice showed that chronic intranasal administration (for
9 months) of recombinant human Hsp70 in“old”NMRI (Naval Medical Research
Institute) mice (17 months of age) caused improvement in spatial memory, increase
in proteasome activity in the brain and longer lifespan (Bobkova et al. 2015 ).
In this context, it is interesting to note studies on naked mole rat which have a
long lifespan (~31 years). The liver tissue of these animals has higher proteasome
activity compared to that of mice. The proteasome of these animals also is resistant
to blockade of activity by proteasome inhibitors such as MG-132 and lactacystin.
Furthermore, a proteasome-depleted cytosolic fraction from liver lysates of naked
mole rat contains a“factor”that confers inhibitor-resistance to yeast, mouse, and
human proteasomes. Additional analyses showed the cytosolic factor contained heat
shock proteins Hsp72 and Hsp40. Given that the effect of the factor on increasing the
chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome and imparting inhibitor-resistance
could not be reconciled with any known properties of the heat shock proteins,
whether additional components of this factor are responsible for these functions
remains to be determined (Rodriguez et al. 2014 ).
Althoughthere are no rigorous studies on humans to test augmentation of the
proteasome and its possible beneficial effects on ageing, there is circumstantial
evidence that enhanced proteasome activity is associated with reduction of damaged
proteins. Research on the effects of zinc supplementation in older adults tested
protein oxidation levels in lymphocytes from peripheral blood and proteasome
activity. The results showed a reduction in protein oxidation levels and an increase
in the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome (Cabreiro et al. 2008 ). Support
for a role of robust proteasome activity in healthy ageing also comes from investi-
gations of proteasome activity infibroblast cultures of healthy centenarians. The
peptidylglutamyl peptidase activity of the proteasome was maintained at high levels
in a centenarian and RNA expression of a proteasome subunit PA28β(11Sβ) was
comparable to that of younger individuals (8 and 28 years old) and more than that of
a healthy older (80-year-old) one (Chondrogianni et al. 2000 ).

###### Conclusion and Future Directions

Based on the research on several different model systems, it appears that the catalytic
activities of the 20S proteasome (chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, peptidylglutamyl
peptidase) are reduced with ageing although in varying patterns. Sometimes alter-
ations in the activities of the proteasome are accompanied by changes in expression
levels of some 20S proteasome subunits as well as those of the 19S regulatory cap.
Evidence is also slowly accumulating with respect to the causative role of the
proteasome in longevity. With respect to ageing, future research would benefit
from experimental approaches to test the mechanistic links between the proteasome
and the“ageing phenotype”as well as cross-talk between the proteasome and other
cellular clearance systems such as the lysosome and the autophagosome. In addition,
it would be fruitful to develop strategies to study specific substrates of the 26S
proteasome that are integral parts of the molecular mechanisms underlying the
ageing process. In the coming years, we might expect advances in techniques to
stimulate the proteasome using small molecules with a view to develop therapeutic
approaches to enhance degradation of damaged or misfolded proteins.

Abstract Gap junctions, comprising connexin proteins, create conduits directly
coupling the cytoplasms of adjacent cells. Expressed in essentially all tissues,
dynamic gap junction structures enable the exchange of small molecules including
ions and second messengers, and are central to maintenance of homeostasis and
synchronized excitability. With such diverse and critical roles throughout the body,
it is unsurprising that alterations to gap junction and/or connexin expression and
function underlie a broad array of age-related pathologies. From neurological dys-
function to cardiac arrhythmia and bone loss, it is hard to identify a human disease
state that does not involve reduced, or in some cases inappropriate, intercellular
communication to affect organ function. With a complex life cycle encompassing
several key regulatory steps, pathological gap junction remodeling during ageing can
arise from alterations in gene expression, translation, intracellular trafficking, and
posttranslational modification of connexins. Connexin proteins are now known to
“moonlight”and perform a variety of non-junctional functions in the cell, indepen-
dent of gap junctions. Furthermore, connexin“hemichannels”on the cell surface can
communicate with the extracellular space without ever coupling to an adjacent cell to
form a gap junction channel. This chapter will focus primarily on gap junctions in
ageing, but such non-junctional connexin functions will be referred to where

###### Introduction

###### Gap Junctions and the Connexin Family

Intercellular communication is common to, and essential for, all multicellular life. A
primary means by which cells communicate directly with each other is via gap
junctions; densely packed, yet dynamic, arrays of intercellular channels comprising
connexin proteins (Kumar and Gilula 1996 ; Sohl and Willecke 2004 ). Six connexin
proteins oligomerize to form a connexon, or hemichannel, which is trafficked to the
cell surface where it can communicate with the extracellular milieu or, when forming
a gap junction, can couple with a connexon channel on an apposing cell (Fig.6.1)
(Nielsen et al. 2012 ). Gap junction channels coalesce into dense arrays of hundreds
to thousands of channels termed gap junction plaques. Gap junctions enable the
direct exchange of small molecules, typically estimated at 1 kDa or less, including
ions and metabolites by coupling the cytoplasms of adjacent cells, effecting electri-
cal and metabolic intercellular coupling. Occurring across all organs and tissues, and
even within those made up of motile cell populations such as the immune system,
gap junctions represent a common and rapid mechanism for cells to communicate.
Cell-type/tissue specificity in gap junction coupling is achieved through differential
expression of specific connexin proteins, of which 21 have been identified in humans
and are named based on predicted molecular weight (Cruciani and Mikalsen 2006 ).
Alterations in gap junction function and expression are associated with an array of
human medical disorders, with disruptions in gap junction intercellular communi-
cation (GJIC) associated with, and underlying, many pathologies associated with
ageing.
Throughout the evolution of multicellular organisms, a necessity for direct
intercellular coupling to maintain homeostasis and perform complex coordinated
actions between cells resulted in the gap junction. Invertebrates utilize innexin
proteins which are essentially homologous to the vertebrate pannexin family.
Connexins evolved as separate genes in vertebrates to form gap junctions, with the
same protein topology as innexins/pannexins. Vertebrate pannexins, however, serve
solely as channels communicating between the cell and extracellular environment
(Goodenough and Paul 2009 ; Herve et al. 2007 ). Of the 21 human connexins,
connexin43 (Cx43, gene nameGJA1) is the most ubiquitously expressed and
intensely studied. Much of our understanding regarding gap junction regulation is
based upon Cx43 research, but it should be noted that many specific binding partners
are connexin-specific in this highly active research space (Smyth and Shaw 2012 ).

Connexins are transmembrane proteins encompassing intracellular N- and
C-termini, four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and one intracel-
lular loop (Fig.6.1). This general protein structure is conserved across all connexins,
with the least degree of conservation occurring within the C-terminal tail and
portions of the extracellular loops attributed to hemichannel-hemichannel binding
(Cruciani and Mikalsen 2006 ; Sohl and Willecke 2004 ). Complexity of gap junction
regulation and tissue-specific function is augmented through the ability of distinct
connexins to complex with each other, whereby protomers within the same
connexon may encompass a mix of connexins, forming what is termed
“heteromeric”connexon hemichannels. Moreover, coupling between connexons
on apposing cells may occur between distinct connexons, creating what are termed
“heterotypic”gap junction channels (Das Sarma et al. 2001 ; Koval 2006 ). Impor-
tantly, only certain connexins will oligomerize together, and only certain connexins
within connexons will couple as gap junctions based upon extracellular loop
sequences. With differential expression of connexins across cell types, the potential
for exquisite control of specific cell-cell coupling within diverse cellular populations,
andfine-tuning of what molecules are conducted through gap junctions, is vast.

Early expression of specific connexins ensures correct electrical coupling in the heart
during development, so it stands to reason that aberrant expression of connexins in
stressed or ageing tissue can underlie either limited, or inappropriate, intercellular
communication affecting normal physiology (Zhang et al. 2011 ). Indeed, such
alterations in connexin function have been reported in aged tissues with major
associated pathologies including dementia, cataracts, bone loss, and cardiac
arrhythmogenesis.

###### Regulation of Gap Junctions at the Molecular Level

###### Gene Structure and Transcription

Regarding gene structure, most connexin genes simply comprise two exons sepa-
rated by an intron of variable size with the entire protein coding sequence residing
within the second exon. Alternative splicing and dynamic transcription start site
usage contribute to variability in mRNA 5^0 untranslated regions (UTR), which are
largely encoded in thefirst exon. Some connexin genes are slightly more complex,
however, and include two or more 5’UTR exons (e.g., Cx45;GJC1) and others
(Cx36;GJD2and Cx23;GJE1) include single introns interrupting coding regions
(Condorelli et al. 1998 ; Jacob and Beyer 2001 ). Splice variants do not alter protein
sequences however, as variability in mRNA content seems to exclusively occur
within the 5’UTR, highlighting translational control as an important facet of
connexin regulation (Anderson et al. 2005 ; Pfeifer et al. 2004 ; Zeitz et al. 2019 ).
Dynamic transcriptional regulation of connexins occurs during normal develop-
ment as cell types differentiate and invest in tissue formation. Several transcription
factors (TFs) are known to regulate transcription of connexin genes, with some
acting on several connexins and some displaying unique specificity, reviewed in
Oyamada et al. ( 2013 ). Likewise, a variety of signal transduction cascades have been
demonstrated to induce or suppress connexin transcription by acting directly and
indirectly on these TFs. The ubiquitous TFs acting on connexin genes include
activator protein-1 (AP-1), TATA-binding protein (TBP), and Sp1/Sp3 (Oyamada
et al. 2013 ). In addition to binding sites for these general TFs, promoters of connexin
genes also contain sequences that complex with cell-specific TFs. For example,
Nkx2.5 is well-studied for its role in cardiovascular development and regulation for
the three major cardiac connexins Cx40, Cx43, and Cx45 (Dupays et al. 2005 ).
Additionally, during development, the TF IRX-3 regulates connexin expression in
the His-Purkinje network of heart, specifically through repression of Nkx2.5 pro-
motion of Cx43 transcription (Zhang et al. 2011 ). While such regulation during
development enables specific patterning of connexin expression within and across
tissues, alterations in TF expression of function during ageing could therefore affect
not just gap junction formation, but expression of specific connexins which may
normally require restricted expression for normal organ function.


6 Gap Junctions and Ageing 117

Ageing-associated epigenetic mechanisms affecting gene expression is an area of
intense research, and connexins are most certainly subject to such dynamic regula-
tion (Pagiatakis et al. 2021 ; Vinken 2016 ). Research into the role of histone
acetylation in regulation of connexin gene expression is dominated by use of
compounds such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. In general, HDAC
inhibitors increase connexin expression, facilitating AP-1 and SP1 binding to elicit
transcription, for example (Hernandez et al. 2006 ). Methylation within the promoters
of connexin genes negatively regulates their expression, and can lead to pathological
silencing of connexin expression during cancer progression (Chen et al. 2003 ;
Piechocki et al. 1999 ). During ageing, acetylation and methylation are altered, but
additional research is needed to understand specifically how this pertains to changes
in connexin expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) also provide a mechanism for
modulation of connexin expression and are expressed differentially during ageing
(Kinser and Pincus 2020 ). The list of miRNAs known to directly or indirectly
regulate connexin expression is constantly growing, with several such miRNAs
identified as undergoing altered expression in disease states. Specifically, miR-206
has been demonstrated to negatively regulate Cx43 in skeletal muscle and osteo-
blasts, where modulation of cellular differentiation through targeting Cx43 occurs
(Anderson et al. 2006 ; Inose et al. 2009 ). miR-1 also targets Cx43 in myoblast
differentiation, but is upregulated in coronary artery disease and thought to contrib-
ute to arrhythmogenesis in the heart (Anderson et al. 2006 ; Yang et al. 2007 ). More
recently, miR-1 has been demonstrated to regulate muscle function during ageing,
highlighting the potential significant impact of such post-transcriptional regulation
on gap junctions in ageing tissues (Schiffer et al. 2021 ).

###### Translation

Translational control is now well accepted to function as a dynamic process as
evidenced through increasing reports demonstrating discordance between the
transcriptome and proteome (Payne 2015 ). Protein translation is subject to regulation
at the global cellular level through modulation of signaling pathways converging on
the translational machinery, such as PI3k/AKT/mTOR and/or RNA binding proteins
(RBPs) (Araujo et al. 2012 ). At the gene-specific level, inclusion/exclusion of
specificciselements within mRNA can influence the translational readout, as
described forGJA1below. Internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) within 5’UTRs
enable translation of mRNAs when cap-dependent protein synthesis is inhibited,
such as during stress or cell division (James and Smyth 2018 ). Cx43 (GJA1) and
Cx32 (GJB1) encoding mRNAs have been reported to harbor such IRES sequences
in their 5’UTRs (Hudder and Werner 2000 ; Schiavi et al. 1999 ). Interestingly,
mutations ablating the Cx32 5’UTR IRES result in the genetic nerve disorder
Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, confirming the importance of translational control
on gap junction regulation (Hudder and Werner 2000 ).


118 M. J. Zeitz and J. W. Smyth

Translation of connexins has garnered increased interest in recent years given the
discovery thatGJA1, and likely other connexin mRNAs, undergoes“internal”
alternative translation initiation within the coding sequence to yield truncated
isoforms that impact gap junction formation, amongst other functions (Salat-Canela
et al. 2014 ; Smyth and Shaw 2013 ; Ul-Hussain et al. 2014 ). While up to 6 internally
translated isoforms of Cx43 have been identified, the most robustly expressed and
currently best understood, is GJA1-20k. The GJA1-20k isoform encompasses most
of the fourth transmembrane domain and entire C-terminus of Cx43. As research
progresses, GJA1-20k may well account for several of the “non-junctional”
intercellular functions of Cx43 historically attributed to its C-terminus. GJA1-20k
positively regulates formation of Cx43 gap junctions and importantly, internal
translation ofGJA1mRNA is subject to dynamic regulation whereby its expression
is inhibited by growth factor signaling cascades including mTOR, ERK1/2, p38, and
Mnk1/2 (James et al. 2018 ; Salat-Canela et al. 2014 ; Smyth and Shaw 2013 ; Zeitz
et al. 2019 ). GJA1-20k has also been found by others to perform functions indepen-
dent of its role in Cx43 gap junction formation. These include stabilization of actin
filaments to direct Cx43 trafficking, promotion of mitochondrial transport, and
protecting Cx43 from degradation to prevent arrhythmias (Basheer et al. 2017 ;Fu
et al. 2017 ; Xiao et al. 2020 ). Recently, GJA1-20k was observed to be upregulated in
response to ischemic injury, and experimental overexpression prior to ischemic
injury was found to therapeutically regulate cardiac mitochondrial function and
biogenesis (Basheer et al. 2018 ). Increases in GJA1-20k levels at early time points
in cells exposed to hypoxic conditions have been reported in other studies. This
gives way, however, to a robust reduction in GJA1-20k expression during stress
indicating the importance of considering the duration of the stressor (Zeitz et al.
2019 ). A direct role for GJA1-20k in the transcriptional regulation of N-cadherin to
control cell migration was also recently observed (Kotini et al. 2018 ). These studies
highlight the diverse biological activity of GJA1-20k and its importance in health
and disease, with a common outcome that GJA1-20k promotes cardiac health. The
signaling cascades controlling internal translation ofGJA1, and therefore gap junc-
tion formation, are often reported as deregulated in ageing and age-related pathol-
ogies (He et al. 2020 ; Papadopoli et al. 2019 ; Zeitz et al. 2019 ; Zeitz and Smyth
2020 ). Although complex, it is important that we consider effects on mRNA trans-
lational readout, and not just transcription and/or posttranslational protein modifica-
tions elicited by these cascades.
Moving from cellular signaling cascades to connexin/gene-specific regulation of
translation, as stated above, by altering 5’UTR composition and thus modulating the
inclusion ofcisregulatory elements, alternative promoter usage has widespread
implications for proteome regulation (Araujo et al. 2012 ). Implementation of rapid
amplification of cDNA ends under conditions where GJA1-20k translation was
suppressed revealed the existence of distinctGja1mRNA transcript variants (with
varying 5’UTR length) whose unique translational regulation controls gap junction
formation (Zeitz et al. 2019 ). Elevated stress signaling in aged mouse heart tissue,
correlates with alternativeGja1promoter usage generating transcript isoforms that
modulate Cx43 translationand suppression of GJA1-20k synthesis to reduce gap


6 Gap Junctions and Ageing 119

junction formation (Zeitz et al. 2019 ). Therefore, targeting these pathways may
represent a viable approach to preserving gap junction coupling during ageing
through promotion of alternative translation.

###### Trafficking

Connexins predominantly adhere to the canonical membrane-protein vesicular trans-
port pathway, being co-translationally translocated into the membrane of the rough
ER before progressing through the Golgi apparatus, assembling into hexameric
channels, and being transported to the cell surface via the dynamic microtubule
and actin cytoskeletons (Smyth and Shaw 2012 ). Of relevance to ageing, studies in
cardiac tissues have demonstrated that increased oxidative stress disrupts this pro-
cess, through perturbation of microtubule-mediated delivery of connexons to the
plasma membrane (Smyth et al. 2010 ). Cx43 protein has a half-life of just 1–5h
depending on cell/tissue type and so alterations in forward transport to the cell
surface rapidly affect gap junction coupling with significant impact on cardiac
function, for example (Beardslee et al. 1998 ; James et al. 2018 ; Smyth and Shaw
2012 ). GJA1-20k has been shown to facilitate Cx43 trafficking through both pro-
motion of hemichannel formation at the Golgi apparatus, and stabilization of actin
structures in cardiomyocytes to promote trafficking ofde novochannels to the gap
junction (Basheer et al. 2017 ; James et al. 2018 ). Together with altered TSS usage
resulting in differential translation ofGJA1mRNAs, thesefindings connect tran-
scriptional events directly with the regulation of gap junction formation.

###### Posttranslational Modification of Connexins

Given their essential function and the constant necessity of intercellular communi-
cation across tissues, connexins are remarkably short-lived proteins (Beardslee et al.
1998 ). The evolutionary advantage to this may be to enable rapid shutdown of
intercellular communication and limit spread of toxic metabolites. During ageing,
tissues experience chronic alterations in signaling, with increased hypoxia and often
inflammatory states contributing to direct and indirect remodeling of gap junctions.
As discussed above, connexin protein expression can be impacted from transcription
to translation, and gap junction formation is dependent upon dynamic trafficking
(Smyth and Shaw 2012 ). Connexin proteinsen routeto the cell surface and within
gap junctions are also subject to a variety of posttranslational modifications typically
attributed to affecting channel function, gap junction formation and stability, and
eventual degradation (Johnstone et al. 2012 ). Unlike similar channels, such as
pannexins, connexins are not known to be glycosylated. Phosphorylation of the
connexin protein c-terminus has been intensely studied, but additional modifications
including nitrosylation and ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like (neddylation, sumoylation)


120 M. J. Zeitz and J. W. Smyth

are being increasingly recognized (Kjenseth et al. 2012 ; Lillo et al. 2019 ; Pogoda
et al. 2016 ).
Phosphorylation of connexins is complex, with most research focused historically
on the Cx43 C-terminus. Taking Cx43 as a model gap junction channel, these studies
have informed the importance of phosphorylation on gap junction assembly, con-
ductance, stability, and internalization/degradation. Several kinases converge on the
Cx43 C-terminus to elicit positive and negative effects on gap junction formation
and function (Marquez-Rosado et al. 2012 ). Although a constantly evolvingfield,
here we list the primary kinases and known impact of their acting upon the gap
junction. PKA, driven by cAMP, is associated with promotion of gap junction
assembly (Paulson et al. 2000 ). Once in the gap junction, phosphorylation of Cx43
Ser368 by PKC is associated with reduced channel opening probability, and occurs
during stress and pathological gap junction remodeling (Lampe et al. 2000 ; Smyth
et al. 2014 ). During stress/injury Akt phosphorylates Cx43 at Ser373, promoting
Ser368 phosphorylation, and acting upstream of MAPK phosphorylation events that
elicit gap junction internalization and degradation (Dunn and Lampe 2014 ; Smyth
et al. 2014 ; Solan and Lampe 2014 ). Counter to this, Casein Kinase 1 can exert
protective effects on gap junctions through phosphorylation of sites, which when
phosphomimetically mutated, preserve cardiac gap junctions and protect against
arrhythmia during stress (Remo et al. 2011 ). Connexin tyrosines are also subject to
phosphorylation by Src where they also appear to be targeted during the cascade of
phosphorylation eliciting gap junction degradation (Solan and Lampe 2020 ). The
sheer number of sites dynamically phosphorylated on just one connexin speak to the
depth of regulation to which gap junctions are subjected. From an energetic per-
spective, internalization of gap junctions is a major commitment by the cell. It stands
to reason, therefore, that several“checkpoints”exist where communication can be
reduced (i.e., through Cx43 Ser368 phosphorylation) prior to eliciting the endocytic
and degradation pathways. Internalization of gap junctions has been reportedly
controlled through ubiquitination and progression to the lysosome or
autophagosome. Interestingly, gap junctions can be internalized in their entirety,
with one cell phagocytosing part of its neighbor to form double-membrane“annular”
gap junctions that are degraded in the autophagosome (Fong et al. 2014 ; Gilleron
et al. 2009 ; Hesketh et al. 2009 ). Redox changes are of high relevance to ageing and
altered gap junction and hemichannel functions. From cardiac systems to cataract
formation, oxidative stress and its direct and indirect impacts upon gap junction
function have been subject to intense study (Berthoud and Beyer 2009 ; Smyth et al.
2010 ). Overall, signaling pathways induced by chronic stressors, such as hypoxia,
impact every step of the gap junction lifecycle and reduce intercellular communica-
tion. While evolutionarily this might be an attempt by the cell to limit the spread of
damage, it can have severe deleterious effects on several major organ systems during
ageing, the major of which are described below.


6 Gap Junctions and Ageing 121

###### Heart

The heart is arguably one of the, if not the, most intensely studied organs in terms of
gap junction biology. Every heartbeat depends upon the coordinated contraction of
billions of individual cardiomyocytes, a feat achieved through the electrical
intercellular coupling effected by gap junctions (Nielsen et al. 2012 ; Rohr 2004 ;
Shaw and Rudy1997). Cardiomyocytes are large highly polarized cells that mechan-
ically and electrically couple to each other end-to-end via a complex junctional
structure known as the intercalated disc (ID), where gap junctions are highly
enriched. Other ID resident junctions include desmosomes and adherens junctions,
and significant interplay/cross talk occurs between these and gap junctions with
increasing evidence that these junctions are far removed from the discrete indepen-
dent structures they were once thought to be based on historical pathology (Forbes
and Sperelakis 1985 ; Vermij et al. 2017 ; Zhao et al. 2019 ). Cx43 gap junctions also
facilitate enrichment of the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.5 at the ID,
specifically within the perinexus adjacent to gap junctions, where ephaptic electrical
coupling of cells occurs in addition to the direct exchange of ions via gap junctions
(Agullo-Pascual et al. 2014 ; George et al. 2016 ; Leo-Macias et al.2016a, b;
Veeraraghavan et al. 2015 ). The composition, amount, and size of gap junction
plaques in the mammalian heart vary by region. This variability contributes to
regulating specialized physiological functions such as cardiac conduction veloc-
ity and cell-specific electrical coupling. The three predominant connexin isoforms
present throughout the cardiac conduction system (CCS) and working myocardium
are Cx40, Cx43, and Cx45 (Severs et al. 2008 ). Specific localization of Cx43 gap
junctions to the ID of the ventricular working myocardium is necessary for the
anisotropic propagation of action potentials and coordinated contraction. It is well
established that alterations in Cx43 expression and/or gap junction function underlie
the arrhythmias of sudden cardiac death. In addition to loss of expression,
relocalization of Cx43 away from the ID to lateral cardiomyocyte plasma mem-
branes has been demonstrated to create a substrate for electrical reentry to initiate
arrhythmias in stressed heart tissue (Peters et al. 1997 ; Severs et al. 2008 ).
Aside from the cardiomyocyte, the true muscle cells of the heart, the CCS
comprises specialized myocytes that initiate and rapidly propagate action potentials
throughout the myocardium. Proper CCS function is necessary to ensure coordinated
contraction of the cardiac chambers beginning with the atria and then apex-to-base
contraction of the ventricular myocardium. This exquisite orchestration of action
potential propagation exploits specific connexins to utilize gap junctions with
differing conductance. The cells of the sinoatrial (SA) node play the critical role of
cardiac pacemaker and initiate each electrical signal that goes on to form a heartbeat.
Gap junctions in the SA node are less numerous and of smaller sizes than the
working myocardium. The predominant connexins expressed within the SA node
include Cx45 and Cx40. Interestingly, alterations in Cx43 expression at SA node
periphery may be linked to sick sinus syndrome in the elderly (Jones et al.2004a).
TheSAnode resides in the wall of the right atrium, and following initiation of the


122 M. J. Zeitz and J. W. Smyth

action potential, the atria are thefirst region to receive this signal and are character-
ized by rapid conduction velocity with the principle connexins expressed being
Cx40 large-conductance gap junction channels and Cx43 medium-conductance
gap junction channels (Vozzi et al. 1999 ). The electrical signal then arrives at the
atrioventricular (AV) node which serves to slow conduction originating from the
atria to ensure completion of contraction and emptying of blood from the atria prior
to ventricular depolarization. Many factors contribute to this slowing of conduction,
including limited GJIC between myocytes due to smaller gap junction size and
conductance together with reduced NaV1.5 expression (Greener et al.^2011 ; Shimada
et al. 2004 ). AV nodal cells express Cx45 and Cx40, with Cx30.2 reported in the
mouse although its corresponding human isoform Cx31.9 has not been detected
(Coppen et al. 1999 ; Kirchhoff et al. 1998 ; Kreuzberg et al. 2006 , 2009). Specifi-
cally, the relatively slower conductance of Cx45 gap junctions in the AV node is
suggested to contribute to slowing of conduction. Action potentials then progress
through the CCS to the bundle of His from where the bundle branches arise and
rapidly propagate signal down the septum towards the cardiac apex. The Purkinje
fibers then spread the depolarization signal throughout the working myocardium of
the ventricles, achieving apex-to-base contraction. A gradient of specific connexin
expression through the bundle branches and Purkinjefibers ensures rapid impulse
propagation and appropriate electrical coupling with the working myocardium.
Specifically, Cx40 dominates initially, with Cx43 expression gradually increasing
through the Purkinjefiber network allowing direct coupling with cardiomyocytes
and subsequent activation. Given the essential role of gap junctions in every step of
the CCS coordinating impulse propagation and contraction of the working myocar-
dium, it is unsurprising that alterations in connexin expression and function affecting
gap junctions during ageing underlie a variety of cardiac disease states.
The ageing heart is susceptible to pathological remodeling affecting multiple
levels of organization ranging from whole heart size to molecular components
(Bonda et al. 2015 ; Cheng et al. 2009 ; Cohn et al. 2000 ; Fannin et al. 2014 ).
Reduced connexin expression at the mRNA and protein level has been reported in
hearts of aged guinea pigs, mice, and humans, and it is now well established that
conduction velocity slows with ageing (Jones et al.2004a; Roberts-Thomson et al.
2009 ; Spach and Dolber 1986 ; Stein et al.2008a). Indeed, alterations to gap junction
expression and function are reported throughout essentially all structures of the heart
during ageing. Age-related changes to SA node have been reported in guinea pigs
SA nodes, where detection of Cx43 by immunostaining progressively declines from
the center outward throughout ageing. Cx43 levels are observed lower by western
blot and this correlates with slowed conduction velocity (Jones et al.2004b; Peters
et al. 2020 ; Saeed et al. 2018 ). Further into the CCS,“heart block”is the term used to
describe a disruption in impulse propagation, often resulting in AV dissociation.
Remarkably, it is estimated that 30% of individuals over 65 years of age harbor some
form of heart block or conduction defect (Fleg and Kennedy 1982 ). Such loss in
CCS function and ventricular conduction often involves induction offibrotic mech-
anisms with gap junction remodeling occurring separately or as an indirect conse-
quence as the tissue remodels.


6 Gap Junctions and Ageing 123

Atrialfibrillation (AF) represents the most common cardiac arrhythmia, with
more than 37 million people worldwide living with this disorder (Lippi et al. 2021 ).
Whilefibrillation of the atria is not as directly lethal as ventricularfibrillation in
terms of cardiac pumping function, the resulting pooling of blood creates a signif-
icant risk of clot formation and stroke. Ageing is a primary risk factor for AF, with
clear involvement of gap junction biology demonstrated through studies revealing
human atria have progressive reduction of Cx43. Cx43 has also been reported to be
reduced in aged guinea pig atria at mRNA and protein levels (Nagibin et al. 2016 ).
Activation of JNK signaling during ageing is believed to contribute to gap junction
remodeling. Consistent with this, experimental JNK activation reduces gap junc-
tional Cx43 in HL-1 myocytes and aged mice (Yan et al. 2018 ). An additional study
also reported reduction of total Cx43 levels and increases in phosphorylated Cx43 as
a result of an increase in activated JNK in the right atria of guinea pigs during ageing
(Jones and Lancaster 2015 ). Patients with left atrialfibrillation have increased
TGF-β1, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), RAC1, and N-cadherin, consistent
withfibrotic tissue remodeling. While Cx43 is also upregulated, it is lateralized away
from gap junctions. In mice, TGF-βactivates RAC1 and CTGF andin vitroexper-
iments confirm CTGF upregulates NCAD and induced aberrant Cx43 expression in
primary neonatal cardiomyocytes (Adam et al. 2010 ).
Disruption of Cx43 localization to the ID of ventricular cardiomyocytes results in
decreased gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) and increased suscepti-
bility to arrhythmias of sudden cardiac death (Gutstein et al. 2001 ). In the ventricle,
ageing reduces Cx43 gap junction coupling and increases ventricularfibrosis,
increasing arrhythmia risk in aged mice (Jansen et al. 2012 ; Stein et al.2008b).
Aged rat myocardium was also reported to express significantly less Cx43, as
determined by immunofluorescence microscopy (Watanabe et al. 2004 ). Cx43 is
also reduced in the LV myocardium and mitochondria of aged mice hearts, and this
correlates with loss of cardioprotection during ischemic preconditioning (Billur et al.
2022 ; Boengler et al. 2007 ). AlthoughGja1mRNA levels were not changed, Cx43
protein levels were reduced in 24-month-old aged mouse hearts observed by western
blot, implicating post translational mechanisms affecting Cx43 stability.
Remodeling of intercalated disc was observed including lateralization of Cx43 by
confocal microscopy. Interestingly, desmosomes were not affected despite losses in
gap junctions at the ID which correlated with prolonged ventricular depolarization
(Bonda et al. 2015 ). Alterations in GJA1-20k expression, and therefore gap junction
formation, have also been reported in aged mouse hearts. As discussed above, here
altered TSS usage downstream of p38 signaling was found to result in truncating
Gja1mRNA 5’UTRs to limit internal translation and subsequent gap junction
formation (Zeitz et al. 2019 ).

###### Brain

Intercellular communication in the brain occurs through chemical synapses which
rely on the release and detection of neurotransmitters, and through electrical synap-
ses encompassing gap junctions and adhesion proteins (Martin et al. 2020 ). While
the number of electrical synapses decreases significantly during development, their
maintenance in the adult brain is associated with complex roles, for example
effecting neuronal synchrony and rhythmicity, and supporting cognitive functions,
including learning and memory (Bennett and Zukin 2004 ; Connors 2017 ; Connors
and Long 2004 ). The primary connexin expressed by neurons responsible for
electrical synapse formation is Cx36 (GJD9), with additional connexins expressed
in other brain cell types and the ocular system, described below. Just as in the heart,
neuronal gap junctions have surprisingly short half-lives, which enables plasticity
during normal cellular functions, but also results in rapid losses in direct intercellular
coupling during stress.
Glia, the major non-neuronal cells of the brain, are increasingly gaining interest as
targets for therapeutic intervention due to their key role in numerous aspects of brain
physiology. Neuroglia cells, originally thought to passively support neurons, are
now recognized to play much more critical roles in neuronal function including
uptake of neurotransmitters to modulate synaptic transmission and providing
immune support. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type within the adult
brain, are implicated in an array of neurodegenerative diseases, many of which are
associated with ageing. Astrocytes express high levels of connexin proteins with
Cx43 and Cx30 being the dominant isoforms and Cx43 and Cx30 double knockout
mice display significant neuropathology (Lutz et al. 2009 ). Cx43 has long been
observed to form gap junction channels in astrocytes (Giaume et al. 1991 ), but in
addition to gap junctions, astrocytes express significant levels of non-junctional
Cx43 hemichannels on their surface that can open to the extracellular space. These
hemichannels have been demonstrated to release glutamate and glutamine to affect
synaptic function with implications in neurodegenerative disease as elevated gluta-
mate is associated with neuronal cell death (Cheung et al. 2022 ; Ye et al. 2003 ).
The role of astrocytes and Cx43 in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a disorder where
age is well established as the primary risk factor, has seen increased attention.
Transcriptome analysis of postmortem brain samples from patients identifiedGJA1
as a key regulator of AD (Kajiwara et al. 2018 ). A hallmark of AD is the formation of
extracellular amyloid-β(Aβ) plaques which are associated with areas of neuronal
death. In both mouse models of AD and in tissue from human AD patients, Cx43
labeling was observed to be elevated proximal to Aβplaques (Mei et al. 2010 ; Nagy
et al. 1996 ). In cell culture experiments, treatment with Amyloidβ-Protein Fragment
25 – 35 (Aβ 25 – 35 ) was observed to increase Cx43 hemichannel activity while reducing
GJIC (Maulik et al. 2020 ). As mentioned above, such increased Cx43 hemichannel
activity that triggers excessive glutamate release from astrocytes has been demon-
strated to induce neurotoxicity (Orellana et al.2011a, 2011b). Deletion of astroglial
Cx43 improved synaptic function in a mouse model of AD, as did pharmacological


6 Gap Junctions and Ageing 125

inhibition of hemichannel activity (Ren et al. 2018 ;Yietal. 2017 ). Therefore,
modulation of Cx43 function to promote gap junction formation and limit Cx43
hemichannel activity may represent a viable therapeutic approach for AD.

###### The Ocular System

Ocular lens epithelial cells initially express Cx43, but as they differentiate intofiber
cells expression of Cx50 transiently increases and Cx46 eventually dominates.
Alterations in these gap junctions are understood to contribute to cataract develop-
ment during ageing both through mutation and loss of channel function. Cataract, a
clouding of the lens, is the leading cause of blindness worldwide with ageing being
the greatest risk factor. As stated above, connexins expressed in the lens include
Cx43, Cx46, and Cx50. Cx50 is expressed throughout the cells of the lens. Cx43 is
predominantly expressed in the lens epithelial cells and immature outerfiber cells,
while Cx46 is expressed at greater levels as the differentiatingfiber cells mature
(Mathias et al. 2010 ). Fiber cell differentiation includes loss of cellular organelles
which renders GJIC crucial for supportingfiber cell homeostasis. It is unsurprising
that several studies have historically linked disruptions in connexin expression to
cataract development and associated losses in Cx46 and Cx50 with ageing (Gong
et al. 1997 , 1998, 2021;Rong et al. 2002 ; White et al. 1998 ). Homozygous Cx46
knockout mice developed cataract by 2 months of age (Gong et al. 1997 ). Homo-
zygous Cx50 knockout mice also develop cataract with an additional feature of
reduced lens mass (Rong et al. 2002 ; White et al. 1998 ). Interestingly, a large
number of germline mutations in human Cx46 and Cx50 have also been identified
as causative in hereditary forms of cataract (Shi et al. 2022 ; White and Paul 1999 ).
These results indicate the importance of both these connexins function to lens
transparency. Examination of the lens in aged mice observed decreased Cx46 and
Cx50 expression correlating with a reduction in gap junction coupling conductance
(Gao et al. 2013 ). An initial hypothesis of the role of gap junctions in cataract
suggested that, during ageing, increased oxidative stress leads to impaired GJIC, and
this impairment could hinder the circulation of antioxidants leading to cataracts in
the lensfiber cells, reviewed in Berthoud and Beyer ( 2009 ). A recent study exam-
ining mouse models of human congenital cataracts with mutations in Cx46 or Cx50
casts doubt on oxidative stress being an early event in cataract formation in these
mice however (Jara et al. 2020 ). There are increasing data suggesting instead that
impaired GJIC leads to accumulation of calcium and calcium precipitation to
generate cataracts (Berthoud et al. 2019 ; Minogue et al. 2022 ). In addition to gap
junctional mechanisms of cataract development, it should be noted that connexin
hemichannels have been suggested to play a protective role against oxidative
damage potentially through the uptake of glutathione and their dysregulation may
also be a contributing factor in ageing-associated lens pathologies (Shi et al. 2018 ).

###### Bone

Bone is a dynamic structure that is continuously remodeled throughout an
organism's lifespan. As age increases, remodeling shifts balance to an increase in
bone degradation and a decrease in new bone formation (Demontiero et al. 2012 ).
Remodeling is controlled by numerous factors including hormonal signaling and
mechanical load (Robling et al. 2006 ; Siddiqui and Partridge2016). This remodeling
is accomplished through the coordinated work of multiple cell types including
osteoclasts, and osteoblasts. Osteoclasts are large multinucleated cells that function
to break down bone in a process termed resorption. Osteoblasts, on the other hand,
function to synthesize bone matrix promoting new bone formation. Terminally
differentiated osteoblasts, termed osteocytes, are encased in bone matrix in pockets
called lacunae and communicate through cellular protrusions within canaliculi
connected to neighboring cells forming a complex network that modulates bone
formation and communicates through both GJIC and Cx43 hemichannel functions
(Civitelli 2008 ; Marotti et al. 1992 ). Cx37, Cx45, and Cx46 are also detected, but
Cx43 is the most abundantly expressed connexin in bone, and is expressed in all
three of the aforementioned cell types (Civitelli 2008 ; Civitelli et al. 1993 ; Ilvesaro
et al. 2000 ). Cx43 has been demonstrated to play a key role in osteocyte survival
with mice lacking Cx43 displaying increased osteocyte apoptosis, leading to
endocortical resorption and periosteal bone formation (Bivi et al. 2012 ; Plotkin
et al. 2008 ). Just as in other tissues where GJIC is essential, Cx43 RNA and protein
levels within bone have been observed to decrease with age (Davis et al. 2017 ). An
additional study in rat osteoblastic cells saw no change in Cx43 expression with age,
but did identify age-dependent effects on GJIC in response to parathyroid hormone
(PTH) stimulation which normally increases cAMP and gap junction formation
(Genetos et al. 2012 ). The authors associate this with perturbed G protein coupled
receptor signaling in aged animals, which limits the cellular ability to respond to
PTH and increase GJIC. Osteocyte apoptosis also increases with age and
overexpression of Cx43 in osteocytes reduces apoptosis in aged mice and results
in reduced endocortical bone resorption (Davis et al. 2018 ). Recently, it was found
that Cx43 reduction in osteocytes leads to reduction of microRNA 21 (miR21),
which is sufficient to induce apoptosis and disrupt a signaling cascade regulating
osteoclast formation (Davis et al. 2017 ). Together, this data indicates a prominent
role for Cx43 mediated osteocyte viability and suggests age-related reduction in
Cx43 can disrupt the balance of bone remodeling. The relationship between
hemichannel function controlling bone remodeling in addition to GJIC once again
presents a complex mechanism that is an active area of research where changes in
Cx43 expression affect far more than gap junctions in the aged bone microenviron-
ment (Hua et al. 2021 ; Plotkin et al. 2015 ).


6 Gap Junctions and Ageing 127

###### Other Tissues

The liver is rich in gap junctions and predominantly expresses Cx26 and Cx32. A rat
model of natural ageing showed their expression at the protein level is reduced in
hepatocytes during ageing. Interestingly mRNA levels do not fall early in ageing,
signifying that altered connexin protein stability/regulation occurs prior to losses in
gene expression (Moscato et al. 2020 ). Additional research here has focused on the
influence liver gap junctions have on tissue regeneration, carcinogenesis, and/or the
intersection with lifestyle factors such as alcoholism (Dagli et al. 2004 ; Naiki-Ito
et al. 2012 ). Epithelial barriers in general are known to deteriorate during ageing,
which clearly involve perturbed gap junction formation and function (Parrish 2017 ).
Such compromised barrier function is a key component of ageing-associated lung
disease, for example, but a direct causative role for gap junction loss has not been
established whereby alterations to connexins may occur downstream of tight junc-
tion disruption. Alterations in connexins are involved in a variety of lung patholo-
gies, however, and further research may connect ageing-related changes to
development of pulmonary disease (Swartzendruber et al. 2020 ). Gap junctions
also play important roles in the ear, and mutations in connexin genes are well
established in both non-syndromic and syndromic deafness. Research interrogating
these mutations, primarily in Cx26, has provided extensive insight into the role of
gap junctions and hemichannels in effecting normal hearing (Beach et al. 2020 ;
Martinez et al. 2009 ). Regarding age-related hearing loss, it has been proposed that,
in addition to possible downregulation of connexin expression, oxidative stress
could impair connexins to affect cochlear function (Martinez et al. 2009 ). In line
with this, a recent study analyzing connexin expression and function in ageing mice
demonstrated that older animals had smaller and fewer cochlear gap junctions,
concomitant with reduced Cx26 and Cx30 protein levels (Tajima et al. 2020 ).
Finally, gap junctions play key roles in several aspects of reproduction and fertility,
with disruption in connexin expression and function occurring with age. Briefly, in
terms of women’s reproductive health, disruption of connexin expression and
function impair fertility through oocyte deficiencies and GJIC is critical in the uterus
for placental formation and implantation, for example (Kaushik et al. 2020 ;
Winterhager and Kidder 2015 ). In males, both erectile dysfunction and reduced
spermatogenesis, which occur during ageing, are associated with alterations to gap
junctions in the penile erectile tissue and testes, respectively (Christ 2000 ; Melman
and Christ 2001 ; Sridharan et al. 2007 ).

###### Concluding Remarks

As direct intercellular communication is critical across all organs and tissues for
normal function, it is unsurprising that pathological gap junction remodeling is a
hallmark of so many ageing-related maladies. Increased understanding of connexin


128 M. J. Zeitz and J. W. Smyth

regulation however is creating hope that a better understanding of the gap junction
life cycle will inform therapeutic interventions and strategies aimed at preserving
intercellular communication, and therefore more normal physiological functions,
during ageing.

#### Cellular Senescence and Ageing

Rebecca Reed and Satomi Miwa

Abstract Cellular senescence has become a subject of great interest within the
ageing researchfield over the last 60 years, from thefirst observationin vitroby
Leonard Hayflick and Paul Moorhead in 1961, to novelfindings of phenotypic
sub-types and senescence-like phenotype in post-mitotic cells. It has essential roles
in wound healing, tumour suppression and the veryfirst stages of human develop-
ment, while causing widespread damage and dysfunction with age leading to a raft of
age-related diseases. This chapter discusses these roles and their interlinking path-
ways, and how the observed accumulation of senescent cells with age has initiated a
whole newfield of ageing research, covering pathologies in the heart, liver, kidneys,
muscles, brain and bone. This chapter will also examine how senescent cell accu-
mulation presents in these different tissues, along with their roles in disease devel-
opment. Finally, there is much focus on developing treatments for senescent cell
accumulation in advanced age as a method of alleviating age-related disease. We
will discuss here the various senolytic and senostatic treatment approaches and their
successes and limitations, and the innovative new strategies being developed to
address the differing effects of cellular senescence in ageing and disease.

###### What Is Cellular Senescence?

Cellular senescence is a state of irreversible growth arrest in which cells cease to
proliferate but do not undergo apoptosis. Instead, these cells experience significant
changes in morphology, metabolism and enzyme activity, as well as developing a

pro-inflammatory phenotype with wide-ranging implications for the surrounding
microenvironment. These phenotypic changes are responsible for both beneficial
and detrimental roles of senescent cells in human development. While such cells are
key to embryonic development, wound healing and tumour suppression in early life,
they have also been associated with ageing and age-related disease. In each of these
circumstances, senescent cells accumulate as a result of upregulated anti-apoptotic
pathways and downregulated pro-apoptotic pathways, promoting cell survival and
persistent cell cycle arrest.
One of the major determining factors of a senescent phenotype is the activation of
a persistent DNA damage response (DDR). Double- and single-strand DNA breaks
are detected by DNA damage kinases ataxia-telangiectasis mutated (ATM), ataxia-
telangiectasis and rad3-related (ATR) and DNA-dependent protein kinase
(DNA-PK) (Ciccia and Elledge 2010 ), which initiate a cascade of downstream
signalling to recruit DNA repair proteins. Factors involved in this DNA repair
process localise at the site of damage and can form foci identifiable by immunoflu-
orescent staining and used in the detection of senescent cells (d'Adda di Fagagna
et al. 2003 ; Jackson and Bartek 2009 ). Such factors include ATM (Dupre et al.
2006 ), p53 binding protein (53BP1) (Eliezer et al. 2009 ) and phosphorylated histone
2AX (yH2AX) (Burma et al. 2001 ). H2AX is also responsible for chromatin
remodelling protein recruitment, which allows alterations to chromatin structure to
permit DDR protein access to the site of damage (Nakamura et al. 2010 ).
ATM and the checkpoint kinase Chk2 also promote activation of the transcrip-
tional regulator p53 (Turenne et al. 2001 ), a major regulator of both senescent and
apoptotic pathways (Seluanov et al. 2001 ). p53 in turn stimulates activation of the
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 (Jackson and Pereira-Smith 2006 )
leading to cell cycle arrest (Dutto et al. 2015 ) via retinoblastoma protein (pRb)
hypophosphorylation and stabilised binding to E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1)
(Georgakilas et al. 2017 ). Chk2 is also responsible for the degradation of CDC25
phosphatase, which prevents G1-S phase transition and supports growth arrest
(Mailand et al. 2000 ). An additional barrier to cell cycle progression is established
by double strand break (DSB) activation of the CDK inhibitor p16, a positive
regulator of the pRb pathway and able to induce cell cycle arrest by inhibiting
CDK4/6 and reinforcing pRb inhibition by E2F1 (Beausejour et al. 2003 ).
The major beneficial role of cellular senescence is as a tumour suppressor
mechanism. By preventing damaged and pre-malignant cells from dividing, cellular
senescence acts as a barrier to tumour development. This is largely achieved by
modifying levels of cell cycle regulators, primarily p53, p21 and p16, which induce a
permanent halt to cell cycle progression. Secretion of SASP factors IL-6 and IL-8
can also interact with specific cell-surface receptors to trigger signalling pathways
such as the DDR. This is discussed in further detail below.
During mammalian embryonic development, senescent cells have been found in
the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and neural roof plate. It is here that senescent cells
are thought to influence growth and patterning through p21, p15 and SASP signal-
ling. Indeed, studies have found that mice lacking p21 exhibit dysfunctional embry-
onic senescence (Storer et al. 2013 ). Notably, twofibroblast growth factor genes


7 Cellular Senescence and Ageing 141

(FGF4 and FGF8) involved in AER signalling for proliferation and pattern formation
were also reduced in p21-deficient mice, suggesting that this aspect of AER function
is compromised when senescence is prevented. Senescent markers have also been
linked to placental formation and function. In particular, the known SASP compo-
nents matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 MMP2 and MMP9 are important in
achieving trophoblast invasion in early pregnancy, demonstrating a link between
SASP and placental development. Moreover, activity of these MMPs is decreased in
murine placentas with deficient senescent signalling (Gal et al. 2019 ). Other reports
have detailed a p21-dependent senescence in the mesonephros and endolymphatic
sac in the inner ear (Munoz-Espin et al. 2013 ).
Cellular senescence is also important to the process of wound healing, both by
limiting proliferation of damaged tissue and recruiting immune cells to eliminate the
accumulated senescent cells. This is demonstrated in liverfibrosis, where senescent
hepatic stellate cells are known to accumulate and secrete greater levels of extracel-
lular matrix (ECM) degrading enzymes and are the subject of enhanced immune
surveillance. This promotes immune-mediated clearance of the senescent cells,
alleviatingfibrosis progression and liver scarring (Krizhanovsky et al. 2008 ). Similar
findings have also been reported in the pancreas, in which accumulated senescent
pancreatic stellate cells correlate with greater inflammation andfibrosis, which is
limited by immune-mediated clearance of senescent cells (Fitzner et al. 2012 ).
Furthermore,in vivostudies have demonstrated that cellular senescence is involved
in tissue regeneration in both zebrafish (Da Silva-Alvarez et al. 2020 ) and salaman-
ders (Yun et al. 2015 ).
In addition to mediating immune clearance of senescent cells, pro-inflammatory
SASP factors are also involved in numerous other processes within wound healing.
For example, platelet-derived growth factor AA (PDGF-AA) accelerates wound
closure by promoting myofibroblast differentiation (Demaria et al. 2014 ), while
cellular communication network factor 1 (CCN1) limits skinfibrosis by inducing
fibroblast senescence via cell-surface receptor interaction in cutaneous wound
healing (Jun and Lau 2010 ). These senescent cells exhibit a persistent DDR, p53
and p16 activation, and express antifibrotic genes. This, along with SASP-mediated
clearance of the senescent cells, restricts fibrosis in cutaneous injury. The
pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is responsible
for triggering immune-mediated clearance of senescent cells by recruiting key
immune cells including macrophages, B cells, T cells and NK cells (Coppe et al.
2008 ; Krizhanovsky et al. 2008 ; Storer et al. 2013 ). This clearance of senescent cells
is key to both wound healing, by limiting scarring andfibrosis, and tumour suppres-
sion, by eliminating pre-malignant and damaged cancerous cells (Xue et al. 2007 ;
Krizhanovsky et al. 2008 ; Ruscetti et al. 2018 ).
In contrast to these positive effects in early life and development, it is well
established that senescent cells are also associated with the ageing process and
age-related disease, discussed in greater detail in the section on Senescence and
Age-Related Disease, below. Alongside this, the SASP has been shown to possess a
paradoxical role in cancer development over time. While SASP factors are key to
immune-mediated clearance of senescent cells, contributing to tumour suppression,


142 R. Reed and S. Miwa

it has also been noted that the chronic inflammation generated by SASP production
may contribute to diseases such as diabetes (Xu et al. 2015 ; Prattichizzo et al. 2018 ),
COPD (Birch et al. 2015 ), osteoarthritis (Livshits et al. 2009 ; Xu et al. 2017 ) and
cancer (Bavik et al. 2006 ; Coppe et al. 2010 ; Ortiz-Montero et al. 2017 ). It has also
been observed that accumulation of senescent cells can promote cancer develop-
ment, and can be accompanied by SASP-mediated paracrine effects on cancer
progression (Eggert et al. 2016 ; Lau et al. 2019 ) and treatment failure (Demaria
et al. 2017 ). Notably, Demaria and colleagues reported that selective elimination of
senescent cells by navitoclax treatment alleviated a number of chemotherapy-
induced side effects, including cancer recurrence and bone marrow suppression.
Similar observations of increased chemotherapy-induced fatigue in patients with
greater senescent marker presence were reported in patients with breast cancer
(Demaria et al. 2017 ).

Cellular senescence wasfirst described in 1961 by Hayflick and Moorhead, who
determined that normal proliferatingfibroblasts in culture were limited to afinite
number of divisions before halting cell cycle progression (Hayflick and Moorhead
1961 ). This is now referred to as the‘Hayflick limit’(Hayflick 1965). This form of
senescence resulting from extended cell culture is termed replicative senescence,
discussed in more detail in the section on Replicative Mechanisms, below. Other
forms of senescent phenotype are triggered by different stimuli, but share a large
proportion of common markers and characteristics are also described below. One
central feature of all of these phenotypes is the choice between apoptosis and
senescence induction. How this choice is made remains unclear, but there are
many possible determining factors, such as damage severity, stimulus type and
cell type. It is also possible that a shared mediator may be involved in this choice,
as both apoptotic and senescent pathways are regulated by the p53 pathway
(Kirschner et al. 2015 ).
The contrasting roles of senescence in embryonic development and early life
versus ageing and disease have also caused much debate within the ageing research
field. It is striking that cells initially so beneficial to human development and survival
should have such detrimental effects later in life. One prominent hypothesis is the
antagonistic pleiotropy theory of ageing, which proposes a preferential selection of
genes with reproductivefitness advantages during early life, but which may come
with negative consequences in later life as an unintended consequence. Though to
date there is little evidence to support this theory.

###### Characteristics and Markers

Cellular senescence can result from numerous stress-inducing triggers including
telomere attrition, persistent DNA damage, oncogene activation, mitochondrial
dysfunction and oxidative stress. The specific senescent profiles produced by each


7 Cellular Senescence and Ageing 143

of these triggers is discussed in further detail below, but there are a number of
common characteristics and markers that are observed in multiple models of senes-
cence (Fig.7.1).

Telomere Shortening

Telomeres are end chromosome structures formed by repetitive DNA sequences and
capped with proteins that protect them from being mistakenly identified as damage
or double strand breaks by DNA repair processes (Blackburn 1991 ; d'Adda di
Fagagna et al. 2004 ). However, DNA polymerase activity during cell division cannot
fully copy these telomeric regions, leading to progressive shortening of telomeres
with each cell division. Eventually, a critical length is reached at which the protec-
tive telomeric caps are lost during replication, and the newly uncapped single-
stranded telomere ends are recognised by DNA repair machinery as double strand
breaks (DSBs) (d'Adda di Fagagna et al. 2003 ). This triggers a DNA damage

Fig. 7.1 The senescent phenotype:Cellular senescence can be triggered by a number of different
stressors, but a selection of common markers have been identified which can be used to determine
the presence of senescent cells. (a) elevated senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal)
activity identified by blue histochemical stain at pH 6, (b) elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS)

response (DDR) which attempts to repair the‘damage’; however, telomeres are
inaccessible to DNA repair machinery as components of the protective shelterin
complex inhibit the non-homologous end joining repair pathway (Bae and Baumann
2007 ). This inability of DNA repair processes tofix the perceived damage leads to a
persistent DDR (Galbiati et al. 2017 ), which is required for cellular senescence
(Fumagalli et al. 2014 ).
Some DNA repair components translocate to the site of the damage and accu-
mulate into identifiable foci. These foci are also present at the sites of non-telomeric
DNA damage, and can be used as quantifiable markers of senescent cells (Takai et al.
2003 ). In the case of telomere attrition, these foci localise at the telomeres and are
termed telomere-associated foci, or TAFs. It is also worth noting that a persistent
DDR can also be triggered at telomeres following DNA damage, irrespective of
telomere length, such as that resulting from ROS-induced oxidative damage (von
Zglinicki 2002 ; Reichert and Stier 2017 ). The reduced efficiency of DNA repair at
telomeres promotes a persistent DDR regardless of the initial cause of damage (Bae
and Baumann 2007 ; Hewitt et al. 2012 ; Fumagalli et al. 2014 ).
The role for telomere shortening in cellular senescence is further supported by the
observation that overexpression of telomerase prevented senescence in a study of
telomerase-negative human retinal pigment epithelial cells and foreskinfibroblasts,
along with extending the replicative lifespan of such cells (Bodnar et al. 1998 ).

DNA Damage

As discussed, a persistent DDR can be triggered by DNA damage at sites other than
telomeres, culminating in permanent cell cycle arrest (Fumagalli et al. 2014 ). Often,
a persistent DDR is triggered by double strand DNA breaks (DSBs), though single-
strand breaks (SSBs) can also trigger a DDR. At these points of damage, key
components of the DNA repair machinery can accumulate and provide identifiable
markers of a persistent DDR and senescent cells. Such markers include phosphor-
ylated histone 2AX (γH2AX), mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein
1 (MDC1), 53BP1 and ATM (Burma et al. 2001 ; Eliezer et al. 2009 ; Lavin et al.
2015 ). These foci of DNA repair machinery components are referred to as DNA
damage foci (DDF), and when present at telomeric sequences, telomere-associated
foci (TAF) which represent a robust marker of senescence (Hewitt et al. 2012 ). Work
by Galbiati and colleagues provided evidence of prolonged checkpoint activation in
senescence by demonstrating the presence of long-term unrepaired DSBs in persis-
tent DDFs (Galbiati et al. 2017 ).
Notably, inhibition of the key DDR factors ATM, ATR and CHK1/2 enables
senescent cells to re-enter the cell cycle, confirming the role of a persistent DDR in
maintaining senescent growth arrest (d'Adda di Fagagna et al. 2003 ; Di Micco et al.
2006 ; Mallette and Ferbeyre 2007 ). The induction of senescence in response to
severe DNA damage also demonstrates its key beneficial role in tumour suppression.
By limiting the proliferation of cells which have accumulated excessive DNA
damage, cellular senescence restricts the ability of pre-cancerous and cancerous
cells to continue to multiply and impact on tissue function.


7 Cellular Senescence and Ageing 145

SA-B-Gal

A common marker of cellular senescence is increasedβ-galactosidase activity
(Dimri et al. 1995 ) that is not observed in quiescent or immortalised cells. Though
β-galactosidase activity has previously been observed in confluent quiescent cells,
this was reversible, distinguishing senescent cells from these phenotypes (Yang and
Hu 2005). Similarly, elevated β-galactosidase activity has been shown in
immortalised cells, but was dependent on high confluency, and in cultures at low
cell densityβ-Gal staining was not observed (Severino et al. 2000 ). This increase in
β-galactosidase activity occurs in response to elevated lysosomal activity (Kurz et al.
2000 ) following induction of senescence (senescence-associatedβ-galactosidase, or
SA-β-Gal). This reliable marker has also been observedin vivo(Dimri et al. 1995 ).
However, while a common marker of senescence it is not unique to the phenotype,
and can also be present in serum-starved or highly confluent cell cultures (Severino
et al. 2000 ; Yang and Hu 2005 ). As such, the presence of SA-β-Gal activity is not
sufficient alone to identify cellular senescence.

Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors

Senescent cells also exhibit greater upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhib-
itors. Specifically, p21 and p16 signalling is key to maintaining the senescent growth
arrest, as inhibitors of cell cycle progression. Serrano and colleagues identified that
mice lacking p16 were more prone to tumour formation (Serrano et al. 1996 ) and that
oncogene-induced senescence involved elevated p16 expression (Serrano et al.
1997 ). p16 has also been used in a number of studies to identify and selectively
eliminate senescent cellsin vivo(Baker et al. 2011 ), which has led to improvements
in age-related pathologies (Baker et al. 2016 ; Bussian et al. 2018 ; Patil et al. 2019 ;
Ogrodnik et al. 2021 ). These two markers are generally robust identifiers of
senescence; however, not all forms of senescence include elevated p16 levels
(Munoz-Espin et al. 2013 ; Storer et al. 2013 ), and some aspects of senescence are
independent of p16 expression. Moreover, in senescent cells lacking p16, an inhi-
bition of p53 activity can cause a dramatic increase in SASP production along with
re-entry into the cell cycle, producing dangerous pro-inflammatory cells prone to
malignant transformation (Beausejour et al. 2003 ; Coppe et al. 2008 ; Rodier et al.
2009 ). Therefore these CDK inhibitors cannot be used individually to confirm the
presence of senescence (Coppe et al. 2010 ).

Morphology

One of the most noticeable markers of senescence is a change in cell morphology.
Upon the induction of a senescent phenotype cells become significantly enlarged,
with aflattened cell body and a greater cytoplasm: nucleus ratioin vitro. The nucleus


146 R. Reed and S. Miwa

itself also becomes enlarged, and can be used as a marker of senescent cells both
in vitroandin vivo(Mitsui and Schneider 1976 ; Yoon et al. 2016 ; Fielder et al.
2022 ). Some studies have even suggested that this increase in cell size may in fact
drive the permanent growth arrest, as a result of a cell’s inability to appropriately
scale up nuclear and protein component synthesis (Neurohr et al. 2019 ).

Chromatin Alterations

Senescent cells also display significant changes to chromatin architecture, including
loss of nuclear lamina allowing release of cytosolic chromatin fragments (CCFs)
(Ivanov et al. 2013 ; Dou et al. 2017 ), the formation of heterochromatin foci (Narita
et al. 2003 ), and altered DNA methylation (Hanzelmann et al. 2015 ).
Senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) can be used as markers of
senescent cells and can be identified as dense DAPI-positive foci within the nucleus.
These condensed chromatin structures are associated with the silencing of E2F
activity and dependent upon the Rb tumour suppressor pathway (Narita et al.
2003 ). Notably, SAHF do not develop in cells where growth arrest is reversible.
However, some have noted that they appear to be specific to oncogene-induced
senescence and senescence induced by stressors of DNA replication. SAHF are also
thought to lessen persistent DDR signalling, as HDAC inhibitor-induced chromatin
relaxation results in elevated DDR signalling and promotion of apoptosis (Di Micco
et al. 2011 ).
CCFs have been found to trigger the cGAS-STING pathway (Chang et al. 2017 ;
Dou et al. 2017 ). Treatment with HDAC inhibitors has also been shown to reduce
CCF formation and subsequent SASP production (Vizioli et al. 2020 ).

Lack of DNA Replication/Cell Proliferation

Another major marker of cellular senescence is the lack of cell proliferation and
DNA replication. These can be identified by immunostaining for the proliferation
marker Ki67 (Lawless et al. 2010 ), though this is not unique to senescent cells.

SASP

The SASP is a major part of the senescent phenotype and responsible for much of
both the beneficial and detrimental effects of senescent cell accumulation. The
secretome is composed primarily of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines,
growth factors, matrix metalloproteinases and ECM-degrading proteins (Coppe
et al. 2008 , 2010). Most commonly, IL-6 and IL-8 are used as identifiers of senescent
cells and are regularly used in cell culture models. These cytokines are also known to
both reinforce and induce senescence via autocrine and paracrine mechanisms
(Acosta et al. 2008 ; Nelson et al. 2012 ). However, it should be noted that some


7 Cellular Senescence and Ageing 147

forms of senescence do not possess the IL-1 arm of the SASP (Wiley et al. 2016 )or
exhibit an otherwise altered SASP not inclusive of these two markers, as in the case
of p16 overexpression (Coppe et al. 2011 ). Moreover, SASP can also vary between
cell type and senescence trigger. Therefore, while valuable markers of senescence,
IL-6 and IL-8 are not sufficient on their own. Nevertheless, there are common SASP
factors observed across most forms of senescence and are widely used together to
monitor the presence of senescent cells and effectiveness of senolytic and
senomorphic drug treatments (discussed below in: Senescence and age-related
disease).
This diverse and variable pro-inflammatory phenotype is primarily controlled via
the transcription regulator NFκB, which regulates the activation of SASP genes
(Chien et al.2011 ; Ohanna et al.2011 ). In multiple models of senescence activation
of the cGAS-STING pathway is known to regulate SASP production via NFκB,
providing a link between CCF formation and SASP production (West et al.2015 ).
Though the relationship between cGAS-STING is not straightforward, as
downregulation reduces SASP productionin vivo, while activation has also been
shown to lead to accumulation of nuclear DNA in the cytosol (Takahashi et al.2018 ).
Numerous other components of the DDR signalling pathway influence SASP
production, and studies have demonstrated that a persistent DDR is required in order
for a full SASP to be established (Rodier et al. 2009 ). Indeed, p38MAPK is known to
be both necessary and sufficient to induce a SASP via NFκB activation (Freund et al.
2011 ). Moreover, inhibition of key DDR components ATM, Chk2 and p53 has been
found to suppress the SASP, while heterochromatin reorganisation and SAHF
formation has been linked to greater nuclear pore density in OIS, which can
influence SASP gene expression (Boumendil et al. 2019 ). High mobility group
box 1 and 2 (HMGB1/2) proteins have also been identified as regulators of the
SASP, by inducing the expression of SASP genes in OIS (Huang et al. 2015 ; Aird
et al. 2016 ) and signalling the immune system to senescent cells (Davalos et al.
2013 ). In contrast, cells which enter senescent growth arrest as a result of p21 or p16
overexpression do not produce a SASP (Rodier et al. 2009 ; Coppe et al. 2011 ),
meaning that SASP production alone cannot be used as a universal marker of
senescence.
Though multiple robust markers of cellular senescence have been identified, no
one marker is unique to senescence, and the heterogeneity of the senescent pheno-
type between cell type, senescent stimuli and resulting phenotypic sub-type show
that not all markers are present in all forms of senescence. Individual markers are
therefore insufficient to identify senescence cells alone, and multiple markers must
be used to determine the presence of cells in a senescent state (Gorgoulis et al. 2019 ).

###### Types and Mechanisms of Cellular Senescence

###### Replicative

Thefirst description of cellular senescence in normal cultured humanfibroblasts by
Hayflick and Moorhead in 1961 pertained primarily to what is known as replicative


148 R. Reed and S. Miwa

senescence; the circumstance in which cells have reached their replicative limit as a
result of critically short telomeres leading to growth arrest. The role of telomere
shortening in senescence has been confirmed by reports of senescence prevention
and extended replicative lifespan in cells overexpressing telomerase (Bodnar et al.
1998 ). Following extended proliferation and the arrival at this critical telomere length
(Harley et al.1990 )—and triggering a persistent DDR as discussed previously—these
cells arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Stein and Dulic1995 ). However, despite
being unable to continue proliferating, such cells are also resistant to apoptotic cell
death processes. This is thought to be a result of upregulated anti-apoptotic members
of the BCL-2 family (Yosef et al.2016 ). It should also be noted, however, that there
are numerous determining factors that impact the response to extreme stress, including
cell type, stimuli strength, and regulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (Rebbaa
et al.2003 ;Hampeletal.2004 ).

###### Stress-Induced

Accumulation of DNA damage at sites other than telomeres and at telomeres that are
not critically shortened can also trigger induction of a senescent phenotype
(Di Leonardo et al. 1994 ). Such damage is most often caused by stimuli such as
ionising radiation, oxidative stress (Parrinello et al. 2003 ), or genotoxic chemicals
including chemotherapeutic drug treatments (Roninson 2003 ). Under these circum-
stances senescent cells have been known to accumulate in young animals, showing
that senescence is not strictly an age-related phenotype (Le et al. 2010 ; Shao et al.
2014 ). This stress-induced senescence primarily involves elevated p16 expression
and pRb signalling pathways in response to DNA damage (Parrinello et al. 2003 ).
Upregulation of pro-inflammatory SASP factors has also been shown to induce
senescent changes in otherwise healthy cells through a process known as bystander
senescence, discussed in further detail later.

###### Oncogene-Induced

Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) wasfirst described by Serrano and colleagues
in 1997, following the observation that oncogenic RAS protein induced premature
cellular senescence characterised by elevated p53 and p16 activity. This was later
supported by others who found a similar senescence induction in the presence of
oncogenic BRAF (Michaloglou et al. 2005 ), E2F (Lazzerini Denchi et al. 2005 ),
PTEN and p53 (Chen et al. 2005 ). It is also thought that OIS may be triggered by
excessive mitogenic stimulation (Mathon et al. 2001 ), supported by the observation
that cells relieved of mitogenic pressure by culture in serum-free medium do not
undergo OIS (Woo and Poon 2004 ). It is important to note, however, that the
extension of replicative capacity by telomerase does not promote cancerous trans-
formation, demonstrating a key difference between immortalised and tumorigenic
cells (Morales et al. 1999 ).


7 Cellular Senescence and Ageing 149

The presentation of this oncogene-induced senescent phenotype is largely similar
to other forms of senescence, with chromatin alterations and formation of hetero-
chromatin foci (Zhang et al. 2005 ), markers of a persistent DDR (Di Micco et al.
2006 ), and establishment of a SASP (Coppe et al. 2008 ). One notable difference,
however, is the induction of a hyperproliferative phase caused by oncogene expres-
sion. This period of hyperproliferation is accompanied by altered DNA replication
and triggers a persistent DDR, as in other senescent sub-types (Bartkova et al. 2006 ;
Di Micco et al. 2006 ; Halazonetis et al. 2008 ).
A role for oncogene-induced ROS production in OIS establishment has been
identified, in which excessive ROS generated by NADPH oxidases promote
hyperproliferation and DNA damage (Ogrunc et al.2014 ). Though this is not univer-
sal for all OIS triggers. For example, activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway induces a
p53-dependent senescence, but lacks the hyperproliferation and DDR observed in
other forms of OIS (Astle et al.2012 ). OIS has also been found to exhibit a more
amplified SASP compared to other forms of senescence (Coppe et al.2008 ).

###### Bystander-Induced

It is also now well established that senescent cells can promote senescence induction
in neighbouring healthy cells though SASP-mediated paracrine effects (Nelson et al.
2012 ). Among the known SASP factors, the transforming growth factor beta
(TGF-β) family, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and chemokines CC
motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) have all been
found to trigger major senescent pathways including a persistent DDR following
interaction with cell-surface receptors (Acosta et al. 2013 ). High levels of IGFβcan
also cause elevated ROS production and p53-dependent DDR (Moiseeva et al.
2006 ).In vivostudies have further demonstrated an increase in senescent cell
accumulation and tissue ageing in a mouse model with shortened telomeres follow-
ing extended exposure to interferon gamma (IFNγ) (Katlinskaya et al. 2016 ),
supporting the role of SASP factors in senescence induction in animal models.
TGF-βsignalling demonstrates a paradoxical effect in bystander senescence, as it
can both cause p16-pRb signalling and SAHF formation (Vijayachandra et al. 2003 ;
Zhang and Cohen 2004 ), and has also been shown to prevent the spread of
bystander-induced senescence in liver, improving regeneration (Bird et al. 2018 ).
The ability of some SASP factors to improve regenerative capacity over short
exposure times has been demonstrated in mouse keratinocytes (Ritschka et al.
2017 ) and skeletal muscle (Chiche et al. 2017 ). Comparatively, following long-
term exposure paracrine senescence is induced, suggesting that this relationship may
be more complicated thanfirst thought and may be dependent on numerous factors.
The ability of the SASP to promote further induction of senescence likely
contributes to the accumulation of senescent cells and deterioration of tissue func-
tion. It is thought that dysfunctional mitochondria produce excessive amounts of
toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can trigger ROS-dependent NFκB
signalling and subsequently senescence in bystander cells (Nelson et al. 2018 ).


150 R. Reed and S. Miwa

###### MiDAS

It has been well established that mitochondria are required for the development of a
senescent phenotype (Correia-Melo et al. 2016 ) and that manipulation of mitochon-
drial function can impact senescence development (Wiley et al. 2016 ). Moreover,
mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to promote senescence, and vice versa
(Correia-Melo et al. 2016 ; Wiley et al. 2016 ; Nelson et al. 2018 ). A major regulator
of this relationship is the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.
Notable changes in mitochondrial morphology during senescence have also been
described, including a hyperfused network with increased mitochondrial mass
(Yoon et al. 2006 ; Dalle Pezze et al. 2014 ).
Work by Wiley and colleagues demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction-
induced senescence (MiDAS) exhibits a unique SASP relative to other forms of
senescence, which lacks the pro-inflammatory IL-1 arm of the phenotype. This is
accompanied by loss of LaminB1, a reduced NAD+/NADH ratio, activation of
AMPK and p53, and—surprisingly—a reduction in NFκB signalling. Inhibition of
sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) specifically resulted in a senescent phenotype with a distinct
secretome lacking IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8. This led to the hypothesis that a functional
mitochondrial network is essential for a complete SASP to occur. Similar mitochon-
drial function-modifying interventions include mtDNA depletion, pharmacological
inhibition of respiratory complexes, and heat shock protein family A member
9 (HSPA9) depletion, a key mitochondrial chaperone, although these are
supraphysiological conditions. Each of these interventions also demonstrated a
unique senescent phenotype lacking the IL-1 arm of the SASP.
MiDAS also appears to be independent of DNA damage and ROS production as
the phenotype is reversible in the presence of pyruvate, but not antioxidants. It is
thought that MiDAS can be driven by a decline in the NAD+/NADH ratio as a result
of mitochondrial dysfunction. A low NAD+/NADH ratio then causes activation of
AMPK and subsequently p53 activation. Notably, elevated p53 activity suppresses
NFκB signalling and is therefore a likely cause of a SASP lacking the IL-1 arm.
Table7.1 is a summaryof someof the well-established markers of senescence
and their presence in specific sub-types of senescent phenotype. It should also be
noted, however, that this list is not exhaustive and that these phenotypes demonstrate
heterogeneity between different cell types, for example. Moreover, there remains
some debate in the literature as to the presence or relevance of these markers
(Mirzayans et al. 2012 ).

###### In Vivo Relevance of Senescent Cells

The well-known roles for senescent cells in human development and disease can be
observed in a variety of tissues, and the development of a robust profile of senescent
markers across different tissue types has been a valuable goal within the ageingfield

for many years. The heterogeneity of the phenotype makes this more difficult, but
over the years senescent cells have been observed in many tissue types and organ-
isms, providing the basis for an overarching picture of senescencein vivo. One major
contributor to this work has been the establishment of key animal models, namely
INK-ATTAC (Baker et al. 2011 ) and P16-3MR mice (Demaria et al. 2014 ). These
models of premature ageing have allowed researchers to examine the progress and
impact of senescent cell accumulation, as well as investigate potential therapeutics
targeted specifically at senescent cells (discussed below, in Anti-senescence inter-
ventions). Importantly, Baker and colleagues demonstrated that selective removal of
p16-expressing senescent cells produced significant improvement in numerous
age-related phenotypes.
Another commonly used model ofin vivoageing is the BubR1 hypomorphic
mouse model, in which mice express ~90% less of the BubR1 protein, responsible
for ensuring chromosome segregation into daughter cells during mitosis. This leads
to a phenotype of shortened lifespan, infertility, and cataracts, among others (Baker
et al. 2004 ) and is associated with greater p16 expression (Baker et al.2008a, b).
Subsequent investigations of this rapid ageing model incorporated theCdkn2ap16-
knockout mice, which produced BubR1 mice lacking p16. These mice consequently
did not develop the ageing-related phenotype of poor muscle, eye and adipose tissue
function (Baker et al.2008a, b), demonstrating the requirement for p16 in the
pro-ageing phenotype. This was further confirmed in a study of naturally aged


152 R. Reed and S. Miwa

mice and the INK-ATTAC system, where an extended lifespan and healthspan was
observed (Baker et al. 2011 ).
It is also worth noting that our understanding of which cells can senesce is also
expanding, with the recognition of senescent markers (Table7.2). In the past it was
thought that cellular senescence was restricted only to cells capable of proliferation.
That has now been called into question by the observation of senescent-like pheno-
types in neurons, skeletal myofibers and cardiomyocytes, among others (Jurk et al.
2012 ; Anderson et al. 2019 ; da Silva et al. 2019 ; Matias et al. 2022 ). Though these
findings are still in the early stages of exploration, it presents an exciting new avenue
for our understanding of cellular senescence as a whole.

7 Cellular Senescence and Ageing 153

###### Age-Dependent Changes in the Abundance

Senescent cells are known to accumulate with age (Dimri et al. 1995 ; Wang et al.
2009 ; Jurk et al. 2014 ). Indeed, ageing is associated with greater prevalence of DDR
signalling in both proliferating and non-proliferating cells (Fumagalli et al. 2012 ;
Rossiello et al. 2017 ). Moreover, the accumulation of senescent cells has been linked
to impaired immune-mediated clearance (Ovadya et al. 2018 ) resulting from a
weakened immune system with age.
In addition to a decline in tissue function, there has also been an observed
reduction in regenerative capacity with greater senescent cell abundance
(Krishnamurthy et al. 2006 ; Sousa-Victor et al. 2015 ). This is thought to result
from an increase in senescent stem and progenitor cells, which subsequently are
unavailable to provide new cells for tissue growth and regeneration. This is also true
of muscle progenitor cells such as satellite cells, which have important roles in
wound healing and regeneration and can become senescent with age, leading to a
decline in wound healing capabilities (Zwetsloot et al. 2013 ; Sousa-Victor et al.
2015 ), as well as a paracrine SASP-mediated impairment of tissue regeneration by
HSCs (Gnani et al. 2019 ).

###### Senescence in Age-Related Disease

The accumulation of senescent cells with age can contribute to overall tissue
dysfunction (Janzen et al. 2006 ; Molofsky et al. 2006 ) and development of disease.
This link between cellular senescence and disorders of ageing has received further
support from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) which confirmed the
INK4/ARF locus as a major genomic determinant of susceptibility to diseases such
as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease and cancer (Jeck et al. 2012 ).
Moreover,in vivostudies have demonstrated significant tissue dysfunction and
shortened lifespan in healthy mice when administered a quantity of senescent cells
via transplantation (Xu et al. 2017 ). The stresses associated with disease can also
trigger greater conversion of cells to senescence, particularly as aged cells are less
capable of combating stress and damage (Weyand and Goronzy 2016 ; Chen et al.
2020 ).
The presence of numerous senescent markers has been identified in age-related
diseases across multiple tissues. For example, shortened telomere length has been
linked to both metabolic and cardiac dysfunction (Benetos et al. 2013 ; D'Mello et al.
2015 ), while levels of key SASP factors within the blood are known to correlate with
chronic disease in advanced age (Fabbri et al. 2015 ). Increased levels of senescent
markers such as p16 have also been identified in heart failure (Chimenti et al. 2003 ;
Schaferetal. 2017), osteoarthritis (Loeser 2009 ; Jeon et al. 2017 ) and diabetes
(Minamino et al. 2009 ), and recent studies have even linked senescence within the
central nervous system to Alzheimer’s disease (Bhat et al. 2012 ; Zhang et al. 2019 ).


154 R. Reed and S. Miwa

Tau-containing neurons have demonstrated a senescence-like expression profile in
mice, while senescent markers including SA-β-Gal, DNA damage and p16 have
been found in retinopathies (Oubaha et al. 2016 ).
Studies of heart health in ageing have reported elevated cell death and hypertro-
phy of heart tissue with advanced age, as well as accumulation of p16INK4a-positive
cells (Chimenti et al. 2003 ). In a mouse model prone to atherosclerotic plaque
formation, plaques exhibit higher levels of p16 and SA-β-Gal activity. Conversely,
plaque formation has been effectively reduced in both p16-3MR and INK-ATTAC
mice by removing p16-positive cells, which also subsequently suppressed the SASP
(Childs et al. 2016 ). Inflammatory macrophages have also been found to express
high levels of p16 in human atherosclerotic plaques (Holdt et al. 2011 ). Interestingly,
some studies have found that senescent cell accumulation may both promote and
prevent aspects of atherosclerosis. Increased expression of p16INK4a, ARF and
p15INK4b has been associated with lower incidence of atherosclerotic vascular
disease (Liu et al. 2009 ). However, while the anti-proliferative role of senescent
cells is favourable for preventing disease development, the pro-inflammatory aspect
promotes atherogenesis which is relieved by targeted clearance of p16INK4a-
expressing cells (Childs et al. 2016 ).
In osteoarthritis models, greater IL-6 secretion (Livshits et al. 2009 ), telomeric
dysfunction (Fragkiadaki et al. 2020 ; Manoy et al. 2020 ) and p16 expression has
been observed (Malaise et al. 2019 ), while selective clearance of senescent cells with
senolytic treatment has shown success in relieving SASP secretion, slowing disease
progression, and improving bone health (Peilin et al. 2019 ). p53 expression and
increased oxidative stress have also been linked to insulin resistance in diabetes, and
adipose tissue samples from patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit prominent markers
of senescence, including SA-β-Gal activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine expres-
sion (Minamino et al. 2009 ).
The SASP has also been proposed as a major regulator in the development of
age-related disease, as chronic inflammation is observed in many conditions such as
atherosclerosis (Zhou et al. 2006 ) and cancer (Thangavel et al. 2011 ). Work by Xu
et al. ( 2018 ) has demonstrated that young mice given senescent cells by transplan-
tation resulted in chronic physical dysfunction. This dysfunction was then relieved
by senolytic treatment. Increased levels of SASP factors such as IL-6 and tumour
necrosis factor (TNF) receptor in the blood have also been identified as predictors of
chronic disease with old age (Fabbri et al. 2015 ).

###### Anti-senescent Interventions

Given the wide-ranging roles of senescent cell accumulation in ageing and
age-related diseases, there has been much research aimed at identifying treatments
targeted at senescent cells specifically. Studies have demonstrated that clearance of
senescent cells can both prolong lifespan in model organisms and alleviate
age-related pathologies (Baker et al. 2011 ; Zhu et al. 2015 ; Roos et al. 2016 ). Two


7 Cellular Senescence and Ageing 155

broad categories of therapeutic intervention have emerged over the years; one
aiming at complete degradation and clearance of senescent cells (senolytics) (Zhu
et al. 2015 ) and one targeting the harmful aspects of the senescent phenotype
(primarily SASP) while allowing the cells themselves to remain (senomorphics/
senostatics). Senolytics commonly target pathways which promote cell survival and
protect against apoptosis. Many studies have investigated the use of senolytics and
senostatics to alleviate the senescent burdenin vivo,with varying degrees of success.

###### Pre-clinical Evidence

In avoiding apoptotic cell death, senescent cells upregulate several anti-apoptotic
factors from within the BCL-2 family. Thus, numerous studies have attempted to
overcome this apoptotic resistance by treating senescent cells with BCL-2 inhibitors.
One of the most commonly tested senolytic treatments is the combination of the
tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib with PI3K inhibitor quercetin (D + Q).
D + Q treatment reduces the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-xL, allowing
clearance of senescent cells. This has resulted in improved health span in multiple
mouse models of cellular senescence (Xu et al. 2018 ). Studies have shown that this
treatment is able to improve vasomotor function in hypercholesterolaemia (Roos
et al. 2016 ) and lung function in pulmonaryfibrosis (Schafer et al. 2017 ). Recently,
D + Q treatment has also been shown to lower SASP factor secretion and senescent
cell burden in a mouse model of age-related intervertebral disc degeneration,
improving cell viability and limiting degradation (Novais et al. 2021 ). In a mouse
model of Alzheimer’s disease, researchers have found that D + Q treatment is also
able to selectively remove senescent cells from Aβplaques, along with an associated
reduction in neuroinflammation and improved cognitive deficits (Zhang et al. 2019 ).
Navitoclax is another well-established senolytic which inhibits anti-apoptotic
members of the BCL-2 family, promoting the release of pro-apoptotic factors (Zhu
et al. 2016 ). Navitoclax-induced clearance of senescent cellsin vivohas been found
to improve ageing-related pathologies of haematopoietic and skeletal muscle stems
cells in both irradiated and naturally aged mice (Chang et al. 2016 ). It has also been
shown to improve atherosclerosis pathology (Childs et al. 2016 ). However, its use in
humans is limited by side effects (Vogler et al. 2011 ).
Other notable senolytics include ABT-737, another inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic
BCL-2 family members (Oltersdorf et al. 2005 , Ritschka et al. 2017 ), EF24 (Li et al.
2019 ), azithromycin (Ozsvari et al. 2018 ) and HDAC inhibitors (Di Micco et al.
2011 ; Samaraweera et al. 2017 ). HDAC inhibitors are able to promote senescent cell
clearance by stimulating chromatin relaxation. This reduces the formation of SAHF
which dampen DDR signalling. With reduced SAHF presence the resulting increase
in DDR signalling promotes apoptotic cell death (Di Micco et al. 2011 ) and has been
corroborated by studies of the senolytic HDAC inhibitor Panobinostat (Samaraweera
et al. 2017 ).


156 R. Reed and S. Miwa

Senolytics have now been successfully used to alleviate disease pathology in
mouse models of numerous diseases, reviewed in detail by Kirkland and
Tchkonia ( 2020 ).
Rapamycin has also been identified as an effective senostatic and targets the
mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) (Brown et al. 1994 ; Sabers
et al. 1995 ). This inhibition of mTORC1 interferes with signalling pathways required
for cell growth and proliferation (Chung et al. 1992 ). Studies have demonstrated that
rapamycin treatment can extend health span, activate autophagy and improve CI
activity (Carames et al. 2012 ; Miwa et al. 2014 ). Other reported effects include the
reduction of elevated mitochondrial mass, suppression of p21 and pro-tumorigenic
SASP factor expression, and reduced prevalence of DNA damage foci (Herranz et al.
2015 ; Correia-Melo et al. 2016 ).
In vivostudies have shown that rapamycin treatment reduces IL-1βexpression
and alleviates cartilage degradation in experimental models of osteoarthritis
(Carames et al. 2012 ). In rat models of type 2 diabetes, rapamycin promotes insulin
sensitivity and reduces inflammation (Zhou and Ye 2018 ). Furthermore, rapamycin
has shown success in preventing Alzheimer’s disease pathology by protecting
against tau-induced neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation (Siman et al. 2015 )
and improved cognitive and cerebrovascular function in apolipoprotein Eε4 trans-
genic mice (Lin et al. 2017 ).
Antisense oligonucleotides are also a new line of investigation in thefield of
senostatics, aimed at inhibiting DDR signalling. This has proven useful in mouse
models of accelerated ageing, which have shown that telomeric ASOs effectively
alleviated a number of senescent markers, improved tissue function and extended
mouse lifespan (Aguado et al. 2019 ).
Metformin is a widely used anti-diabetic drug, but has more recently shown
promise in the treatment of other age-related diseases. Treatment with metformin
has been reported to extend both lifespan and health span inin vivostudies in mice
and worms (Anisimov et al. 2008 ; De Haes et al. 2014 ). Studies investigating the
repurposing of metformin now cover a wide range of age-related diseases including
cancer (Heckman-Stoddard et al. 2017 ), cardiovascular disease (Han et al. 2019 ) and
neurodegenerative diseases (Kickstein et al. 2010 ; Mor et al. 2020 ). Chronic treat-
ment with low dose metformin is able to inhibit age-associated atherosclerotic
plaque formation in ApoE-/-mice (Karnewar et al. 2018 ). In models of myocardial
infarction, metformin treatment has been shown to protect against hypertrophic and
apoptotic remodellingin vivo,whilein vitroit has demonstrated reduced hypertro-
phic and apoptotic responses to stress (Loi et al. 2019 ). Notably, studies have
reported that metformin treatment can improve neuronal insulin signalling in a
model of Alzheimer’s disease, though this was accompanied by an increase in Aβ
levels (Zhang et al. 2015 ). In cancer cell models, metformin inhibits cell proliferation
via the ATM-AMPK-p53/p21CIP1 pathway, and promotes apoptotic cell death
following irradiation (Storozhuk et al. 2013 ).
Morerecently, metformin has shown promise as a senostatic treatment in a wide
range of models, with the added benefit of a known safety profile in humans


7 Cellular Senescence and Ageing 157

(Anisimov et al. 2008 ; Algire et al. 2012 ; Chen et al. 2016 ; Hu et al. 2020 ; Jiang et al.
2020 ; Hansel et al. 2021 ; Le Pelletier et al. 2021 ; Fielder et al. 2022 ).

###### Clinical Evidence

Evidence of beneficial effects of senolytic treatment is now being reported in
humans. In the case of D + Q, clinical trials have shown that patients with idiopathic
pulmonaryfibrosis experienced improved physical function after 3 weeks of treat-
ment (Justice et al. 2019 ). In another study of diabetic kidney disease, patients had
reduced senescent cell burden and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines within
11 days, along with decreased p16, p21 and SA-β-Gal activity (Hickson et al. 2019 ).
The use of mTOR inhibitors clinically is limited by known side effects (Pallet and
Legendre 2013 ; Duran et al. 2014 ), though some trials have found success at low
doses (Mannick et al. 2014 ). For example, mouse model studies have found that
while acute treatment with rapamycin improves insulin sensitivity (Tremblay and
Marette 2001 ; Krebs et al. 2007 ), longer treatment periods worsen hyperglycemia
(Fraenkel et al. 2008 ) and glucose intolerance (Chang et al. 2009 ) in diabetes. It is
also important to note that disruption of mTORC2 can exacerbate insulin resistance
(Lamming et al. 2012 ). Rapamycin treatment has, however, been approved as a
method of immunosuppression following the identification of a major role for
mTOR in regulating SASP and tumour progression (Herranz et al. 2015 ; Thapa
et al. 2017 ). However, there is debate as to the risk-benefit value of rapamycin
treatment in some circumstances (Knoll et al. 2014 ; Hahn et al. 2019 ).
Metformin is a popular avenue of investigation for clinical senostatic use, given
its well-known safety profile and current use in humans as a diabetic treatment.
Clinical trials of metformin as an ageing-related therapy have found that the expres-
sion of DNA repair genes is regulated by metformin in muscle biopsies of older
adults (Kulkarni et al. 2018 ). Trials in cancer therapeutics have also reported that
metformin reduces serum markers of breast cancer risk in women who have under-
gone chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment courses (Goodwin et al. 2008 ;
Campagnoli et al. 2012 ). Review studies have also determined that coronary artery
disease patients experience reduced cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events
and all-cause mortality when given metformin (Han et al. 2019 ).

###### Future Directions

###### How to Better Target Senescent Cells?

While a number of senolytic and senostatic treatments have shown promise in
clinical trials, and have even been approved for the treatment of some age-related
diseases, many are limited by side effect profiles and require much optimisation of


158 R. Reed and S. Miwa

dosage and treatment timings. Moreover, it has not yet been confirmed that long-
term effects following senolytic treatment do not become toxic or detrimental to the
organism. There is also little data on any differing effects of senolytic treatment
when given in old age with an assumed greater presence of senescent cells, or
potentially toxicity in young age, for example treating particular conditions associ-
ated with senescent cells. More study is required to truly appreciate the safety and
effectiveness of senolytic and senostatic drug treatments in different cell types,
senescent triggers, and treatment regimens.
Nevertheless, novel approaches to senescent-targeted treatments are being
reported regularly. The use of senescent-specificfluorescent tracers are becoming
an interesting method of tracking senescent cell burden and therapeutic response
(Wang et al. 2019 ), improving the ability to observe and amend the effects of
senolytic or senostatic treatment in real time, at least in pre-clinical studies. A
number of new studies are targeting specific aspects of the senescent phenotype to
prevent or reduce the impact of senescent cell accumulation. For example, Bernardes
de Jesus and colleagues have shown that viral delivery of telomerase-encoding gene
(Tert) to prevent critical telomere shortening alleviates a number of other senescent
markers and promotes lifespan extension in mice (Bernardes de Jesus et al. 2012 ).
Another approach targets the characteristic increase in SA-β-Gal activity of senes-
cence by coatingfluorophores or cytotoxic chemicals with galacto-oligosaccharides
to direct the delivering nanoparticles to cells with higher SA-β-Gal activity
(Gonzalez-Gualda et al. 2020 ).
Other novel methods of targeting senescent cells concentrate on improving
immune-mediated cell clearance. Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell therapy
is an exciting route of investigation, and studies have recently confirmed that this
strategy can relieve a number of senescence-associated disorders (Amor et al. 2020 ).
An important consideration in these studies, however, is the requirement of specific
marker recognition which may vary between cell type or senescent stimuli. Another
immune-mediated strategy is to target the decoy receptor 2 (DCR2) which is heavily
expressed by senescent cells and can be targeted by natural killer (NK) cells via
perforin-mediated granule exocytosis. The removal of this receptor subsequently
allows the death receptors 4 and 5 (DR4/5) to be targeted by cytotoxic cells for
degradation (Sagiv and Krizhanovsky 2013 ). Furthermore, consistent senolysis such
as by immunotherapy-based strategies might become problematic for example, when
senescent cells are required for wound repair.

###### Important Considerations in Senolytics Treatments

A number of key considerations are emerging from the literature on senolytic
treatments. Primarily, many senolytic drugs require precise optimisation of dosage,
treatment timing and duration in order to avoid toxic side effects. More work is
needed in order to identify the minimum effective intervention for therapies which
result in senescent cell clearance, particularly when considering the function of the


7 Cellular Senescence and Ageing 159

targeted tissue. This is another important consideration to be aware of, as tissue such
as muscle, liver or kidney which have major functional roles in human development
and function may experience greater detrimental effect following senescent cell
clearance if the senescent burden is significant. This should be taken into account
when administering senolytics for particular disorders. For example, some mouse
studies have demonstrated potential toxicity of senolysis in the liver and perivascular
tissue resulting from the removal of senescent endothelial cells, adipocytes and
macrophages, impacting dramatically on tissue function (Grosse et al. 2020 ).
It should also be noted that senolytic efficacy can vary between cell type,
particularly if effective treatment relies on the recognition of specific cell markers.
Similarly, not all senescent phenotypes are created equal, and there is much hetero-
geneity between phenotypes induced by different stimuli. In order to obtain a more
universally effective treatment, targets would have to be identified that are common
to the most forms of senescence. Alternatively, senescent treatment would require
stimuli-specific phenotype targets for individual sub-types, such as MiDAS, repli-
cative, OIS, or stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS).
Additionally, a factor to be aware of when deciding between senolytic versus
senostatic treatment strategies is the potential benefits of“one time” senolytic
treatment compared to continuous administration of senostatic treatment. Though
senolytics may indeed require repeated doses, this is likely to be far less than the
continuous inhibition of SASP and other senescent markers.

###### Concluding Remarks

Senescence is emerging as a more dynamic and heterogenous phenotype thanfirst
assumed, which must be considered when designing treatments targeted at the
clearance or modification of senescent cells. As presented here, there are a number
of distinct senescent sub-types with differing stimuli and phenotypic presentations.
Though there are many overlapping similarities between these phenotypes, their
unique features and regulators should not be discounted. Moreover, it is becoming
clear that cellular senescence has cell type-specific roles throughout human devel-
opment, as well as cell type-specific presentations, and thus their removal may not
have universally beneficial effects. It will be important in future work to address
these specificities of the senescent phenotype, and consider the many variables that
may influence treatment efficacy. Development of methodologies to non-invasively
assess senescent cell abundancein vivowill also be necessary. Importantly, senolysis
in humans has not yet been proven safe or effective, and long-term effects have not
been assessed inin vivomodels. Much has now been revealed of the heterogeneous
nature of cellular senescence, but there is much still to be discovered. The next stages
of investigation may reveal a path to both a more detailed picture of individual
senescent phenotypes and a more tailored approach to senolytic and senostatic
treatment.

#### Modulation of Cellular Senescence

Richard G. A. Faragher, Neda Heidari, and Elizabeth L. Ostler

Abstract Cellular senescence is a permanent state of growth arrest coupled with
profound changes in phenotype that can be triggered by multiple extrinsic or
intrinsic stimuli. Senescence is a process-level example of the evolution of ageing
mechanisms through antagonistic pleiotropy and plays a primary role in tumour
suppression, although evidence is mounting for its involvement in other fundamental
physiological processes. Evidence from human premature ageing diseases and from
transgenic mice in which it is possible to specifically delete senescent cells is
consistent with a model in which the accumulation of senescent cells through the
life course is responsible for later life chronic disease and impairment. The removal
of senescent cells or their reversion to a phenotypically benign state is thus an
important emerging goal of translational medicine.

###### What Is Cell Senescence?

Cell senescence is a state of permanent growth arrest coupled with a major shift in
phenotype in cell populations that undergo mitosis under normal conditions both
in vitro and in vivo. Senescence wasfirst, and most famously, reported in human
fibroblasts by Leonard Hayflick and Paul Moorhead. Their pioneering studies
demonstrated that multiple strains of these cells would only divide for afinite
number of passages in culture. Latent infectious agents, composition of the medium
and depletion of key metabolites were all shown not to be responsible for this failure
to grow. Hayflick also observed thatfibroblast cultures initiated from embryos grew
substantially better than those derived from adults. Combined with the demonstra-
tion that normal somatic cells displayed limited lifespans during serial transplanta-
tion experiments these observations, led Hayflick to formulate acellular theory of
ageing(Hayflick 1965, 1979). The original tenets of this hypothesis were that afinite
lifespan is an intrinsic property of normal human cells, that cell growth in vitro is
somehow related to human ageing and that cultured primaryfibroblasts were a useful
model system in which to study some aspects of in vivo ageing. Hayflick termed this
failure to grow‘senescence’a term which, for good or ill, has stuck. This chapter will
not treat the molecular pathways or phenotypic changes seen in senescence exhaus-
tively since these areas are explored in detail elsewhere in this volume. It is sufficient
to say that for the purposes of this Chapter that senescence can be triggered by
multiple different pathways some of which require cell division (e.g. senescence
induced by telomere shortening) whilst others do not; that the senescent state is
maintained through the action of a variety of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors
(typically p21wafand/or p16INK4a) and that the phenotype of senescent cells is very
different from that of their growing counterparts and is often associated with the
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other enzymes which together form the
senescence-associated secretory phenotype or SASP. Instead, it will focus on evi-
dence consistent with their in vivo importance in key tissues and the main ways in
which the senescent state can be modulated or reversed both in vivo and in vitro to
achieve clinical benefit.
Since Hayflick’s original discovery many different cell types have been shown to
behave analogously to humanfibroblast populations in vitro. Senescent cells have
also been shown by a variety of methods to be present in many different tissues
in vivo. Thisfinally silenced the criticism, not uncommon amongst gerontologists

until the early years of this century, that senescence was simply a‘tissue culture
artefact’unworthy of study. Rather, senescence appears to be a ubiquitous charac-
teristic of cells derived from regenerative somatic tissue and a primary causal
mechanism of ageing and age-related disease. The senescent state is distinct from
necrosis, apoptosis and the multiple overlapping molecular states of transient growth
arrest collectively called quiescence, although linkages to these appear to be medi-
ated through the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis. Senescence limits
the capacity for expansion of clones of cells and thus prevents them from accumu-
lating or expanding pro-carcinogenic mutations, acting thereby as an in vivo barrier
to carcinogenesis. It is thereby effectively a process-level form of the evolutionary
mechanism termed‘antagonistic pleiotropy’which is one of the ways in which
ageing originally evolved in the biosphere.

###### The Relationship Between Cell Senescence and Ageing

Somewhat analogously to Koch’s postulates, any candidate mechanism of ageing
must satisfy three basic criteria. Firstly, the mechanism must be present in vivo;
secondly, it must be capable of exerting a physiological effect (a requirement that
excludes some chronological ageing changes such as the quasi-annual dentine lines
seen in human teeth). Lastly, acceleration or deceleration of the rate at which the
mechanism acts should also either accelerate or decelerate the rate of ageing.
For roughly thefirst 40 years following its discovery cell senescence struggled to
meet thefirst of these criteria. This is because the primary techniques by which
senescent cells were detectable at the time in vitro relied on either label exclusion or
loss of clonogenic capacity. However, the overwhelming majority of the somatic
cells in conditional renewal populations within mammalian bodies are quiescent—
often for periods of years at a time. Simply put, the problem with demonstrating the
presence of senescent cells in vivo was to distinguish between cells which would
never divide again from those that could but had a vanishingly small probability of
doing so on the day of the assay.
Nonetheless some progress was made. An inverse correlation between donor age
and the maximum number of population doublings achieved in vitro was reported by
Martin et al. (1970). This usedfibroblast cultures derived from 100 subjects with an
age range from foetal to 90 years and obtained a regression line with a slope of 0.20
PD per year of donor life (roughly equivalent to an average of one cell division per
fibroblast everyfive years). Although on one level these data were consistent with
cell turnover and the generation of senescent cells in vivo they showed a very high
level of intraindividual variability in the proliferative lifespans of cultures derived
from different donors of the same age and were thus somewhat inconclusive—
whether judged in terms of attempts to establish the presence of increasing numbers
of senescent cells over time in vivo or to gauge their physiological effects.
Retrospectively, the real importance of this study was to highlight the reflexive
conflation by researchers of two distinct aspects of organismal ageing (ageing asthe


178 R. G. A. Faragher et al.

passing of yearsin contrast to ageing asthe decline of physiological function) which
persists to this day. This was brought into sharp relief by Goldstein et al. ( 1978 ) who
demonstrated that physiological and chronological age could be parsed by cultured
dermalfibroblasts from subjects with an age-associated disease (diabetes or predi-
abetes) alongside those from carefully selected healthy‘normal’ subjects. The
former showed a replicative lifespan with a stronger inverse correlation with donor
age than that observed by Martin et al. ( 1970 ) whilst the latterfibroblast cultures
showed no correlation with donor age. This is the result that would be expected if
senescent cells were causal agents of physiological decline (in contrast to a uniform
decline across subjects irrespective of health status which would be more consistent
with a chronological effect).
More important for the existence of senescent cells in vivo was the work of
Schneider and Mitsui (1976) who studied the in vitro growth offibroblasts derived
from‘young’(21–36 years old) and‘old’(63–92 years old) donors. Statistically
significant declines infibroblast migration rate, in vitro lifespan, population growth
rate and saturation density at confluence were shown to be. Colony forming effi-
ciency was also reduced in cultures from old donors compared to those from young
donors. However, none of these differences was as great as those found between
early passage‘young’(<20 PD) and late passage‘old’(>40 PD) embryonic human
fibroblasts. Crucially, these authors also demonstrated that differences in growth
potential betweenfibroblast cultures from old and young donors could not be
explained by simple differences in the‘cellularity’(number of cells per unit tissue)
of old and young skin. Rather the differences in vitro were consistent with the
presence of higher numbers of senescent cells in the older tissues at the time of
biopsy. Although elegant and provocative, the link between these data and the
presence of senescent cells in vivo was inferential and the inference was one that a
significant number of gerontologists preferred not to draw.
A link between the direct visualisation of senescent cells in vivo and health status
was provided by Wolf and co-authors (Li et al. 1997 ) who examined the effects of
age and long-term caloric restriction on the accumulation of senescent cells in the
murine lens (which has the advantage that cell proliferation is limited to a defined
zone). Animals from 4 to 45 months of age were subject to one of two complemen-
tary procedures; either a 2-week infusion of 2 μg/g body weight per hour
bromodeoxyuridine by osmotic minipump followed by histochemical detection of
labelled cells in the proliferative zone and equator of the lens or simple sacrifice and
isolation of lens epithelial cells which were then subjected to a colony size analysis
of the type pioneered by Smith (Smith and Hayflick 1974). Compared to their young
counterparts’, old animals showed a highly significant (p<0.001)increase in the
number of label-excluding cells present in the lens in vivo. These changes were
mirrored in vitro where ~40% of lens cells from 33-month-old mice were senescent
compared to ~20% of cells from their 6-month-old counterparts. The conclusion that
the label-excluding lens cells in vivo are the same population as the senescent lens
cells in vitro seems inescapable and in both arms of the study calorie restriction
significantly reduced their accumulation. Although eclipsed (at least as judged by
relative citations) by the discovery of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase

staining which occurred at roughly the same time, this work was thefirst to establish
a direct link between the relative absence of senescent cells, a deceleration of the rate
of ageing and the extension of healthy lifespan.
In contrast, extensive evidence emerged in thefirst decades following the dis-
covery of cell senescence that pathological life shortening and cell senescence were
related. Multiple research groups demonstrated that patients with the accelerated
ageing disease Werner’s syndrome (an autosomal recessive genetic disease associ-
ated with premature greying and loss of hair, diabetes and cataract formation as well
as dermal atrophy, vascular calcification, arteriosclerosis atherosclerosis, osteoporo-
sis and cancer) showed premature cell senescence. For example, Salk et al. ( 1981 )
studied atotalof 20 Werner’s Syndromefibroblast strains derived from three
patients and concluded that the average cumulative population doubling level
reached by the strains was only 27% of that obtained using 10 non-Wernerfibroblast
strains (obtained from donors whose age ranged from newborn to 34 years). No
overlap between the total replicative potentials of Werner’s Syndrome and normal
cultures was detected in the longest-lived Werner’s Syndrome strain giving only
75% of the shortest-lived normal strain tested. Thisfinding was strengthened by
Tollefsbol and Cohen ( 1984 ) who compared the lifespans of all Werner’s Syndrome
cell strains then published in the literature with those of published normal controls,
the authors concluded that 90% of Werner’s Syndrome cultures had an in vitro
lifespan of less than 20 population doublings. However, whilst these and other
studies clearly established a link between the pathology of Werner’s syndrome
and cell senescence it was possible to ignore the broader implications of these data
by treating the disease as a phenocopy of ageing with mechanisms distinct from, and
irrelevant to, the question of whether cell senescence was of physiological impor-
tance for normal ageing.
Although researchers had previously demonstrated that increased activities for
the lysosomal enzymes were part of the suite of cytological changes seen when
fibroblasts became senescent (Cristofalo and Kabakjian 1975 ; Stanulis-Praeger
1987 ) Campisi and co-authors (Dimri et al. 1995 ) were thefirst to take these
observations and turn them into a robust method for detecting senescent cells
in vivo.Working with seven different strains of humanfibroblasts they modified
the standard catalytic histochemical assay for lysosomalβ-galactosidase activity by
shifting the pH of the reaction buffer away from theβ-galactosidase optimum of
pH 4 to pH 6. This rendered the enzyme less efficient and ensured that only cells with
a high lysosomal mass were‘senescence-associatedβ-galactosidase’(SAβ-gal)
positive. Multiple variations of this technique now exist and when combined with
other methods for the visualisation of senescent cells (reviewed in Faragher 2021 )
theseprovideunequivocal evidence for both their presence in a range of mammalian
tissues and alterations in their frequency and distribution with different pathological
states. This, combined with the evidence that it is possible both to improve health
status through the removal of senescent cells and to compromise it through their
transplantation has established cell senescence as a primary mammalian mechanism
(or‘hallmark’) of ageing.


180 R. G. A. Faragher et al.

With the provisional establishment of cell senescence as a driver of the patho-
genesis of both ageing and age-related disease, Fraser et al. ( 2022 ) have recently
been able to undertake a fascinating bioinformatic study. The authors text mined
~920,00 literature abstracts looking for co-mentions of age-related diseases ageing
hallmarks, including cell senescence. Correcting for different intensities of study
between different diseases they were then able to identify the top 30 ranked
age-related diseases specifically associated with each ageing hallmark. As well as
various cancers, cell senescence was especially strongly associated with osteoarthri-
tis, chronic kidney disease, viral infection and immunodeficiency, hypertension,
COPD, cirrhosis, liver failure and fatty liver disease amongst others. This is an
important new approach that suggests these diseases are particularly strong candi-
dates for therapeutic interventions intended to modulate cell senescence. Based in
part on this new rationale three particularly promising potential areas for intervention
are described below.

###### Therapeutic Opportunities

###### Osteoarthritis

Since chondrocytes are primarily responsible for the anabolic–catabolic balance
necessary for the maintenance and function of cartilage a relationship between
their senescence and the development of osteoarthritis (OA) seems innately plausible
given the strong age association of the disease and the recognition that its patho-
physiology is more complex than simple mechanical wear and tear. Human
chondrocytes undergo senescence when cultured in vitro, usually at around 20– 30
population doublings. They can be efficiently immortalised with telomerase alone
consistent with a primary senescence mechanism that is dependent on p53 and short
telomeres although the possibility of secondary mutations (e.g. in p16) occurring
during the immortalisation process cannot as yet be definitively ruled out.
IL-1-induced senescence is well characterised in chondrocytes. This cytokine was
initially identified in the late 1970s as a potent inducer of cartilage degradation and
was seen as a prime candidate for a causal factor in the development of OA, although
this has been questioned in recent years. Chondrocytes exposed to IL-1βin vitro
enter a senescent state that is associated with the downregulation of one of the major
collagens required to maintain tissue function (COL2A1), increased expression of
p16 and the development of a SASP comprising elevated MMPs (MMP1, MMP13,
MMP3) and cytokines (Il6, IL8, IL-1α, TGF-β). However, the extent to which this
occurs in vivo remains an open question because of the debate around the amounts of
IL1-βpresent in OA tissue. Thus, central to discussions concerning the likelihood of
senescence playing a role in the development of OA is the frequency and distribution
of senescent chondrocytes in normal and diseased tissue, along with the capacity of
such cells to impact local physiology.

Harbo et al. ( 2012 ) characterised the distribution pattern of ultrashort telomeres
and senescent cells in tibial cartilage derived from three older women with bilateral
OA. This involved the use of QFISH for median telomere length in conjunction with
immunostaining for senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) whilst
critically short telomeres were detected using the PCR-based STELA (Single Telo-
mere End Length Assay) technique. The authors found that 70–80% of the
chondrocytes in and around the OA lesions were SAHF positive and this correlated
strongly with the number of ultrashort telomeres (p>0.0002).
There was also a strong inverse correlation between these senescence markers and
distance within the tissue from the lesion sites (p>0.0000006 andp>0.000004 for
SAHF and STELA signals respectively). Clearly senescent cells and dysfunctional
cartilage co-associate. A more recent study (Si et al. 2020 ) used some of the best
characterised markers for senescent cells in vivo (senescence-associated
β-galactosidase activity alongsideγH2AX, p53, p21 and p16INK4aimmunoreactiv-
ity) to determine their frequency in early and mid-stage OA knee cartilage compared
to controls from trauma amputees (n=5 per group, group, mean donor ages
48 – 58 years). Every senescence marker was significantly elevated both in early
OA compared to normal and in late OA compared to early. In the case of SA-βGal
and p16, probably the best markers of cells that have been senescent for extended
periods, the percentages increased from ~20% to ~80% for the former and<10% to
>80% for the latter. Markers conventionally associated with the recent entry into
senescence (γH2AX, p53 and p21) were also very heavily upregulated in diseased
tissue compared to normal controls. Given that a senescent cell percentage of ~10%
is sufficient to produce significant physiological effects, this is a picture of cata-
strophic and ongoing failure.
Direct evidence that the accumulation of senescent cells causes OA, rather than
the OA disease state causing senescence has been provided by the work of Kirkland
and colleagues (Xu et al. 2017). These authors injected small numbers of
chondrocytes from luciferase-expressing transgenic mice into the knee–joint area
of their wild-type counterparts. These chondrocytes were either growth competent or
rendered senescent by exposure to 10 Gyγ-radiation. The presence of the luciferase
transgene allowed the transplanted cells to be followed by bioluminescence demon-
strating that they survived for a sustained period. Mice that received senescent cells
displayed leg pain, impaired performance on rotarod tests and reduced overall
mobility alongside radiographic and histological changes strongly suggestive of
OA in the knees of animals that received senescent, rather than growth competent,
chondrocytes. Crucially, older animals required an infusion of fewer senescent cells
before pathologies became evidence, consistent with an elevated frequency of
senescent cells already present in the tissue.
Further evidence that senescent cells directly cause OA has been provided by
Jeon et al. ( 2017 ). These researchers used a transgenic mouse (p16-3MR) in which
senescent cells express a fusion protein comprising synthetic Renilla luciferase and
monomeric red-fluorescent protein domains, along with a truncated form of herpes
simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-TK). The fusion protein allows the fre-
quency and distribution of senescent cells to be visualised whilst HSV-TK allows the


182 R. G. A. Faragher et al.

same cells to be selectively removed with oral ganciclovir. Following anterior
cruciate ligament transection (ACLT), the authors observed the accumulation of
senescent chondrocytes in the articular cartilage. Elimination of these cells increased
cartilage development and attenuated the development of post-traumatic OA.
As such, cellular senescence is a key step in OA formation and ageing, with
multiple pathways by which it can be modulated, halted or reversed (Coryell et al.
2021 ). Chondrocytes in osteoarthritis display many features of cellular senescence,
such as secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix remodelling enzymes as
well as elevated senescence-associated β-galactosidase and critically short
telomeres.

###### Kidney Dysfunction

The kidney nephron is the basic unit of mammalian nitrogenous excretion, forming
hypertonic urine from isotonic renalfluid and recovering water and essential ions via
a counter-current multiplier in the loop of Henle. A coherent body of evidence now
demonstrates that senescent cells accumulate in multiple different cell types within
the kidney with ageing and that it may even prove to be a primary site of senescent
cell accumulation. Li et al. ( 2020 ) designed highly selectivefluorescent probes for
mammalian lysosomal β-galactosidase (based on a 2-(20-hydroxyphenyl)
benzothiazole scaffold) and established in vitro that the activity of these probes
closely mirrors that of X-gal. The researchers then used these probes to demonstrate
thatfluorescence levels in kidney tissue sections from C57BL/6 J mice were
increased at least 12-fold in 23-month-old mice compared to their 1-month-old
counterparts. Mouse kidney sections showed by far the greatest increase in
β-galactosidase activity with age compared to multiple other organs (e.g. lung,
heart, muscle, brain, spleen and liver) consistent with the extensive accumulation
of senescent cells with age.
Sis et al. (2007) measured levels of senescent cells by p16ink4aimmunostaining in
19 normal live donor kidneys at transplantation (donors aged 36±9.6 years)
35 biopsies with glomerular disease (donor age 47.9±19.5 years) and 12 biopsies
from patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis (donor age 53±20 years). Senescent
glomerular and interstitial cell percentages showed significant increases with disease
(e.g. 2.5±2.8% vs 17.1±12% in the case of glomerular cells from normal and
glomerular disease biopsies) and senescent tubular epithelial cells frequencies were
also strikingly increased between disease and control kidneys (0.2±0.4% in normal
kidneys vs 1.37±0.9% in those with glomerular disease (p<0.001).
The increased frequency of senescent cells in diseased kidneys clearly illustrates
their potential to perturb normal function. However, the phenotype of any kidney
cell type at senescence remains relatively poorly characterised compared tofibro-
blasts. Lu et al. ( 2016 ) studied differential protein expression (by liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed by Western Blotting) between cul-
tures of primary human tubule epithelial cells at passage 3 (30% nuclei stained


8 Therapeutic Opportunities Presented by Modulation of Cellular Senescence 183

positive for 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation but without a labelling
time provided) and passage 6 (10% EdU positive under identical conditions, very
high levels of senescent associatedβgalactosidase-positive cells and treated as the
senescent population). A total of 72 proteins were found to be differentially
expressed (either up or downregulated) between the senescent and growing
populations the majority of which are directly or indirectly with cytoskeletal regu-
lation and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). This is an important
potential association because tubulointerstitial renalfibrosis, progressive connective
tissue deposition on the kidney parenchyma, is a disease-independent driver of renal
dysfunction caused in part by the adoption of an EMT by tubular epithelial cells. The
presence of a SASP in senescent tubular epithelial cells from both rodents and
humans has also been reported (Liao et al. 2021 ; Yang et al. 2022 ; Castellano
et al. 2019 ) and although the physiological relevance of some of these studies is
questionable (e.g. the induction of a senescent-like state in a conditionally
immortalised human tubular epithelial cell line) there is no reason to doubt that
SASP could exist in vivo and exert deleterious effects. The SASP component
Activin A is a profibrotic cytokine associated with the EMT transition in
immortalised human tubular epithelial cells driven into senescence by exposure to
high glucose and TGFβ1 (Bian et al. 2019 ). Since Activin A is expressed during
embryonic kidney development, but not in maturity unless the kidney is damaged,
this is an important observation and highlights the importance of pro-senescence
stimuli not just within a tissue but caused by factors circulating within the kidney as a
result of the circulatory milieu such as the elevated levels of activin A seen in obesity
(Palmer et al. 2019 ). This need not be limited solely to circulating cytokines or other
SASP components. The organic anion transporters (OAT1, OAT3) are heavily
expressed in tubular epithelial cells and are responsible for the uptake of many
anionic waste products as an initial step in the elimination of organic anions. Niwa
and Shimizu (2012) demonstrated that indoxyl sulphate (derived from dietary
tryptophan via conversion to indole in the gut) is taken up by tubular epithelial
cells in vitro through OAT1 and OAT3. Once inside it elevates ROS generation and
triggers a p53-dependent senescent state. In addition, indoxyl sulphate supresses the
expression ofklothowhich is primarily produced in the kidneys and which causes
systemic pro-ageing effects as its levels fall across the life course (Buchanan et al.
2020 ).

###### Liver Dysfunction

Although a primary function of the kidney is the elimination of urea, the main site of
its production is the mammalian liver. The organ performs hundreds of functions
including the production of bile and plasma proteins such as albumin, drug detox-
ification, metabolic waste processing and immunoregulation. If liver failure occurs
metabolites normally processed in the organ accumulate and promote hepatotoxicity
and senescence.


184 R. G. A. Faragher et al.

Wang et al. ( 2014 ) measured hepatocyte senescence in the livers of young
(2-month-old) and aged (18-month-old) normal mice. This was characterised by
loss of proliferation capacity, increased expression of SA-β-gal activity, accumula-
tion ofγ-H2A.X-positive hepatocytes, and elevated levels of p21 and p16. The
percentages of SA-β-gal-positive andγ-H2A.X-positive hepatocytes increased from
1.37±0.64% and 1.73±0.23%, respectively in 2-month-old mice to 40±4.6% and
42.67±3.51% by 18 months of age. This was accompanied by significant increases
in the protein levels of p21 and p16. These data indicate that the proportion of
senescent hepatocytes in the liver of mice increased with age. The same authors also
showed that human hepatocytes gradually undergo senescence with age. Elevated
numbers of enlarged human hepatocytes were observed in healthy liver tissue from
55 to 65 year olds compared to adults aged 21–30 years. Also, approximately 69%
and 72% of old human liver sections were stained positively with SA-β-gal and
γ-H2A.X, respectively, but only 8.2±1.87% and 8.6±1.61% of liver tissues were
stained positively with SA-β-gal andγ-H2A.X, respectively, in younger adults.
Thus, senescent hepatocytes are present in vivo and increase with advancing age.
Senescence in non-parenchymal liver cells may also occur as a result of ageing
and chronic inflammation-associated tissue damage. The existence of cholangiocyte
senescence in a number of biliary diseases including primary sclerosing cholangitis
(PSC), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and biliary atresia (BA) has been described.
Tabibian et al. ( 2014 ) measured the pro-inflammatory activity of cholangiocytes and
markers of cellular senescence in patient livers with PSC, PBC, hepatitis C and
healthy controls to investigate whether cholangiocytes in the PSC liver display
features of cellular senescence (including the SASP). Cholangiocytes in PSC livers
showed increased expression of p16INK4a, histoneγH2A.x foci and decreased levels
of the proliferation marker Ki67. In vivo the level of p16INK4amRNA expression
was significantly higher in PSC cholangiocytes compared to PBC (3.1-fold,
P<0.01), HCV and normal liver tissue samples (both>20-fold,P<0.01). Also,
the percentage ofγH2A.x foci-positive cholangiocytes was significantly greater
compared to other three conditions (P<0.01). Whilst cholangiocytes in the PSC
liver were negative for Ki-67, consistent with senescence. In addition, four known
SASP components, IL-6, IL-8, CCL2 and PAI-1, were significantly upregulated in
PSC cholangiocytes compared to PBC, HCV and normal liver (p<0.01).
A cholangiocytes coculture model was also used to assess whether senescent
human cholangiocytes can induce senescence in bystander cholangiocytes by para-
crine secretion. They demonstrated that bystander cholangiocytes had significantly
increased expression of SA-β-gal when exposed to senescent cholangiocytes directly
treated with H 2 O 2 or LPS over 10 days (p<0.05). In summary, cholangiocytes in
PSC display features and markers which are consistent with senescence and the
increased expression of SASP proteins by senescent cholangiocytes is consistent
with the hypothesis that they can contribute to progressive inflammation and
hepatobiliary injury in primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Liver progenitor cells (LPCs) are a stem cell population within the liver that
express markers for both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes includingα-fetoprotein
(AFP), cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). They


8 Therapeutic Opportunities Presented by Modulation of Cellular Senescence 185

are activated and differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes during extensive
liver injury to regenerate the tissue. However, LPCs lose their proliferative capacity
during ageing. A study by Cheng et al. (2017) showed that LPCs from old mice lost
their activation and proliferation upon liver injury caused by excessive ROS and
chemokine production from activated hepatic stellate cells during ageing. LPC
activation and proliferation were measured in young (2 months old) and old mice
(24 old months) fed with a diet (modified CDE) designed to induce liver damage.
The expressions of LPC-related markers, such as EpCam, CD133 and AFP were
only increased in the livers of young mice (P<0.05) after the CDE diet. Old mice
had significantly lower numbers of proliferative markers including ki67 and cyclin
E1 after the CDE diet feeding (P<0.05), suggesting that the activation and
proliferation of LPCs in old-DDC mice were decreased compared to that of young
mice. In addition, a significant increase in neutrophil infiltration, together with high
levels of ROS (using MDA as a marker of oxidative stress) were observed in livers of
old mice compared to young mice (p<0.01). The results of this study also showed
that the expressions of chemokines such as CXCL1 and CXCL7 from hepatic stellate
cells were responsible for the migration of neutrophils in mice. The mRNA levels of
CXCL1 and CXCL7 were upregulated in livers of old mice compared to young
mice, especially CXCL7 (p<0.01) which indicates that CXCL7 production from
hepatic stellate cells could be an important factor inducing neutrophil infiltration
leading to the negative regulation of LPC response. A significant number of H2AX-
positive LPC cells in old mice confirmed the DNA damage in LPCs, suggesting that
neutrophils inhibited LPC activation and proliferation through oxidative stress and
induction of senescence in LPCs in old mice which resulted from chemokine
production from activated hepatic stellate cells during ageing, and lead to impair-
ment of liver regeneration. Based on thesefindings, decreased LPC activation and
proliferation impaired liver regeneration during ageing as a result of induction of
senescence in LPCs.

###### Therapeutic Strategies

The seminal development of the INK-ATTAC transgenic mouse by Baker and
colleagues allowed researchers to systemically eliminate senescent cells in vivo for
thefirst time. In this model, an FKBP-CASP8 cassette, including a greenfluorescent
protein reporter behind an IRES sequence, is driven by the Ink4a/Arf promoter,
which is only active in senescent cells. Oral administration of AP20187 causes
dimerisation of the caspase 8-FKBP fusion protein transcribed from this cassette
which then in turn causes apoptosis. This and related model systems allow the
contribution of cell senescence to both ageing and distinct pathologies to be tested.
Initially, treatment with AP20187 was shown to substantially delay the onset of
age-related changes in BubR1 progeroid mice compared to untreated controls and
outbred cohorts of INK-ATTAC mice with their senescent cells removed to show an
~25% increase in life span. Further experiments of this type have shown the benefits


186 R. G. A. Faragher et al.

of senescent cell removal in rodents in multiple clinical scenarios clearly implying
that similar benefits will accrue if senescent cells are removed in humans. However,
it is worth sounding a note of caution. The evolutionary life histories of the two
species are not simply different but radically so with regard to critical features
(e.g. population type and degree of genetic drift), see Overall and Faragher ( 2019 ),
that are likely to affect the evolution of ageing. Thus, there is the possibility that
direct translation of clinical benefits into humans may prove to be more difficult or
more limited than is naively supposed.

###### Removal of Senescent Cells

An obvious requirement in order to translate thefindings from these rodent models
into the clinic is tofind compounds capable of killing senescent cells (senolytics).
The BCl2 inhibitor navitoclax was shown to be senolytic in some types of senescent
cells (e.g. rodentfibroblasts and human endothelia) but not others (e.g. human
primary preadipocytes). Recently, navitoclax was shown to provide therapeutic
benefits in rodent models of atherosclerosis, mimicking the effects of senescent
cell deletion models and reducing the size, number and overall burden of athero-
sclerotic plaques. Dual treatment with the senolytic compounds dasatinib and quer-
cetin mimics the results seen in transgenic mouse senescence clearance models and
improves both vasomotor function and vascular stiffness in aged and atherosclerotic
mice, although the mechanistic spectrum of action of these compounds is broad and
caution needs to be applied in ascribing the improvements in health status seen to
senolysis alone.
Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor initially approved for the treatment of
chronic myelogenous leukaemia. Dasatinib and the natural polyphenolic antioxidant
quercetin inhibit key transcriptional nodes used by senescent cells for survival. The
combination of dasatinib and quercetin greatly reduced the senescent cell load under
multiple conditions and other senolytics, for example those based on ferroptosis
(Liao et al. 2022 ) are now in trials in animal models.

###### Blockade of the Senescent Phenotype

Quercetin also inhibits matrix metalloproteinase activity, a class of molecules that
are both SASP components and canonical senescence markers (Freitas-Rodríguez
et al. 2017 ). This illustrates the potential of an alternative route to dealing with the
degenerative effects of senescent cells, the development of senomorphic compounds
capable of blocking their deleterious phenotypic effects rather than killing them.
However, the SASP also has the potential for beneficial effects, depending upon the
biological context (Freund et al. 2011 ). Beneficial aspects can include a reinforce-
ment of growth arrest (Acosta et al. 2008 ), a positive contribution to the clearance of


8 Therapeutic Opportunities Presented by Modulation of Cellular Senescence 187

senescent cells by the immune system (Xue et al. 2007 ) and the suppression of
fibrotic scar formation (Krizhanovsky et al. 2008 ). These need to be traded off
against detrimental effects such as the promotion of malignant phenotypes in
neighbouring cells and accelerated tumour growth (Coppe et al. 2008 ; Krtolica
et al. 2001 ; Gonzalez et al. 2017 ). In addition to being pro-inflammatory, some
SASP factors such as activin A and GDF15 have complex systemic with the
potential to disrupt overall physiological homeostasis at sites distant from their
production. Thus, it will be advantageous for clinicians to be able to modulate the
phenotype of senescent cells as well as being able to clear them.
To that end, we (Alimbetov et al. 2016 ) used two next-generation p38 inhibitors
(UR-13756 and BIRB 796) with markedly improved selectivity and specificity
compared to SB203580 (Bain et al. 2007 ; Mihara et al. 2008 ) and demonstrated
that both compounds are highly effective at blocking the SASP in senescent cells
when used at concentrations known to inhibit p38 MAPK. This strengthens the
evidence base that signalling through p38 MAPK is required for the SASP in human
cells and the fact that BIRB 796 has already been used in Phase III clinical trials
(Force et al. 2004 ) demonstrates that SASP-suppressive compounds targeting the
p38 MAPK have a reasonable chance of entering human clinical use.

###### Controlled Reversal of Cell Senescence

However, in some circumstances suppression of the SASP alone may prove insuf-
ficient to provide clinical benefit and a broader rescue of the senescent phenotype
may be required. A clue to how this might be achieved was provided by the work of
Harries and co-authors who undertook a large-scale (n = 698 individual)
transcriptomic analysis using the well-characterised InCHIANTI human cohort to
examine alterations in gene expression associated with ageing. Relatively few
individual transcripts (~2%) demonstrated large-scale reproducible age-related dif-
ferences in expression. However, gene set enrichment analysis (which determines
whether specific molecular or functional pathways are associated with a given trait)
indicated that the pathways most likely to be disrupted by ageing were those
involved in messenger RNA splicing and post-transcriptional processing. More
difficult to untangle was the relationship between this restriction of splicing factor
activity and cellular senescence. Accordingly, the same group (Holly et al. 2013 )
demonstrated that the senescence of primary humanfibroblasts and human aortic
endothelial cells is associated with restricted splicing factor usage leading to changes
in the ratios of alternatively expressed isoforms of a number of genes relevant to
ageing (including CDKN2A, VCAN1, GRP18, EFNA1, and VEGFA). However,
distinguishing cause from consequence in this system was not possible.
To address causality, we (Latorre et al. 2017 ) treated multiple senescentfibroblast
cell strains with the polyphenolic resveratrol and a series of novel compounds based
on it including ((E)-N-(4-(3,5-dimethoxystyryl) phenyl)methanesulfonamide, (E)-
N-(4-(3,5 dihydroxystyryl)phenyl)acetamide, (E)-5-(4-(3,5-dimethoxystyryl)


188 R. G. A. Faragher et al.

phenyl)-1H-tetrazole and (E)-5-(2-(3,5-dimethoxystyryl)phenyl)-1H-tetrazole). We
predicated this study on prior evidence that resveratrol treatment altered splicing
pattern levels in transformed human cells but its pleiotropic effects (as a radical
scavenger, anti-inflammatory and activity of SIRT1 amongst others) render resver-
atrol itself a poor compound to probe for the mechanism of action by which this
occurs. In contrast, the use of a panel of resveralogues allows these effects to be
dissected (some compounds lacked any anti-inflammatory properties, others were
not SIRT1 activators). In each case treatment of senescent fibroblasts with
resveralogues reverted the pattern of splicing factor expression back to that seen in
young cells and produced a reduction in the senescence-associatedβ-galactosidase-
positive fraction (a widely used marker for the senescent state), an increase in the
cycling fraction (as measured by pKi67 immunoreactivity) and increased cell num-
ber. None of the compounds were senolytic, indicating a genuine reactivation of
previously senescent cells, and the differential SASP suppression capacities of the
resveralogues excluded suppression of paracrine senescence as a primary cause of
this effect. Telomere length in the treatedfibroblasts also increased. This is poten-
tially due to the non-canonical effects of at least two splicing factors. HnRNPD
(known to enhance the promotor activity of the telomerase gene) and hnRNPA1
(required for telomere maintenance in multiple species) although other mechanisms
cannot be ruled out.
An underrecognised issue when using natural products with pleiotropic effects,
such as resveratrol, is the issue of the dose required to produce a given effect.
Polyphenolics typically elicit responses that are both biphasic and cell type specific.
For example, In the case of resveratrol, concentrations above 25– 50 μM typically
trigger growth arrest, senescence, or apoptosis in multiple different cell types which
may be useful in an anti-cancer context. In contrast concentrations below 10μM,
which are much less frequently used in vitro, frequently enhance the growth of log
phase cell cultures and rescue senescence. To better understand the structural
features regulating these biphasic effects we evaluated 24 of our structurally related
resveralogues for their capacity to activate SIRT1, as determined by an ex vivo
SIRT1 assay, their toxicity and their effects on replicative senescence in MRC5
humanfibroblasts (Birar et al. 2020 ). In this screen, minor modifications to resver-
atrol were found significantly to alter the biological activities of the resulting
molecules. For example, replacement of the 3,5-dihydroxy substituents with
3,5-dimethoxy groups significantly enhances SIRT1 activity, and reduces toxicity.
Regardless of modification, at doses of 100μM (frequently used in vitro) many of
the compounds induce senescence in primary MRC5 cells in culture whilst at 10μM,
most of the resveralogues significantly enhance growth consistent with the rescue of
a subpopulation of cells within the culture from senescence. SIRT1 activation is not
required for rescue to occur but enhances the size of the effect. Thus, a key challenge
in this area is to define the pathways that are impacted by compounds such as
resveratrol and to determine which of these are critical in reversing key aspects of
the senescent cell phenotype.


8 Therapeutic Opportunities Presented by Modulation of Cellular Senescence 189

###### Cell Senescence as a Problem in Artificial Organs

Although phenotypes classically associated with the onset of senescence (e.g. the
expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, the presence or absence of a SASP
and telomere length) have been relatively heavily studied in multiple cell types the
effects of the primary phenotypes of differentiated cells have been the subject of far
less intensive scrutiny. Early studies of human keratinocytes demonstrated that
senescence could be separated out from normal differentiation and stratification
either through the emergence of spontaneous mutants (such as the
non-differentiating keratinocyte or NdK phenotype) or through growth in low
calcium medium (Norsgaard et al. 1996 ). Under the latter circumstances, differen-
tiation into mature keratinocytes could be initiated in primary cultures at different
population doubling levels by increasing the calcium concentration in the medium.
Differentiation could also be induced in senescent (35 population doubling) cultures,
but the process was significantly hours (as measured by the expression of human
keratinocyte transglutaminase) slower over thefirst 48 h than in log phase cultures
(0–20 population doublings). Thus, in keratinocytes, the impact of senescence on
core cell type-specific functions is superficially minimal. However, in adrenocortical
cells undergoing senescence in vitro sustained cell turnover induces a parallel loss of
key tissue-specific enzyme expression (17a-hydroxylase) in response to stimulation
with cAMP—suggesting a potential problem in vivo (Yang and Hornsby 1989 ).
Whilst it is possible for those primarily interested in organ function over time to
dismiss some of these changes as irrelevant dedifferentiation phenomena associated
with growth in tissue culture environments that are insufficiently reflective of
conditions in vivo there are situations in which the maintenance of quasi-normal
cell function in vitro are critically important. The clearest examples of these are the
ongoing attempts to produce functional artificial organs incorporating living cells.
The most advanced of these are the various types of bioartificial liver devices
(BALs). These extracorporeal devices are designed to support patients in whom
the liver is failing due to a wide variety of insults (including ageing, alcohol abuse
and acute fulminant hepatic failure induced by paracetamol overdose). The core of
these devices is typically a hollow-fibre tissue culture cartridge containing approx-
imately 800 g of cultured HepG2 cells (although primary porcine hepatocytes are
sometimes used). HepG2 cells are preferred although they have approximately 20%
of the albumin synthesis and urea production capacity of primary hepatocytes they
are easy to expand in culture sufficiently to generate sufficient biomass to populate
the hollow-fibre system.
Although many of the bioengineering issues associated with BALS have been
solved the devices have a very poor record in use and have failed to impact patient
survival to any appreciable extent. A plausible reason for this may well be the
induction of senescence by molecules such as creatinine, bilirubin, sodium
chenodeoxycholate (C-Doca) and ammonia circulating in the patient’s plasma at
supernormal levels due to partial liver failure (and collectively known as liver
toxins). Abrahamse et al. ( 2002 ) populated the bioreactor of their BAL systems


190 R. G. A. Faragher et al.

using primary hepatocytes isolated from the resected livers of pigs. In an elegant
study, these BALS were then either used to treat the donor pig which had rendered
anhepatic, for 24 h (n=5) or the BAL was simply maintained recirculating in tissue
culture as a control. Liver function was unaltered in the controls but key liver
metabolic functions including ammonia clearance, 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase
activity and urea synthesis were markedly reduced after 24 h exposure of hepato-
cytes to autologous porcine plasma although cell viability was unaltered. The
signature of induced senescence seems patent. With HepG2 cells, we have also
found that treatment with a cocktail of liver toxins in vitro for 6 h induces a senescent
state (as measured by loss of pKi67 reactivity and label exclusion) alongside a near
complete loss of albumin synthesis and urea production which can be blocked by
resveralogues. It would thus appear that senescence is a hitherto unrecognised barrier
in the production of BALS and probably, given the data on Kidney Function given
above, attempts to develop bioartificial kidneys. Modulation of cell senescence in
this area is an unexpected new frontier in the biology of ageing and the effects of the
senescent cell.

###### Conclusions

Thirty years ago it was possible for mainstreamfigures within gerontology to hold
the position that the senescence of cells was simply a tissue culture artefact or, at
best, a phenomenon that was unrelated to mammalian ageing. This view is no longer
tenable. Rather, the salient issues are now the relative importance of cell senescence
to other ageing mechanisms, particularly in the human context; the identification of
the tissues in which it is likely to play a primary role, in which bioinformatic
approaches are becoming increasingly important, and optimisation of the approaches
by which the effects of senescence may best be ameliorated in those tissues.
Recognition of the profound effects senescence has on core metabolic phenotypes
of cells in the liver and kidney is becoming increasingly salient which in turn opens
up the possibility that new generations of bioartificial organs may soon become a
reality. Although much work remains to be done before the modification or ablation
of senescent cells is routine clinical practice it is possible to regard the future with
optimism and hold the expectation, rather than simply the hope, that such treatments
will become available for at least some age-related diseases.

Abstract The progression of age triggers a vast number of diseases including
cardiovascular, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Regardless of our plentiful
knowledge about age-related diseases, little is understood about molecular pathways
that associate the ageing process with various diseases. Several cellular events like
senescence, telomere dysfunction, alterations in protein processing, and regulation
of gene expression are common between ageing and associated diseases. Accumu-
lating information on the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) suggests targeting miRNAs
can aid our understanding of the interplay between ageing and associated diseases.
In the present chapter, we have attempted to explore the information available on the
role of miRNAs in ageing of various tissues/organs and diseases and understand the
molecular mechanism of ageing.

development/physiology and pathophysiology of different diseases (Shu et al.
2018 ). Before the discovery of miRNAs, it was considered that gene expression is
regulated primarily by binding of different proteins (like nuclear receptors) or their
ligands on regulatory regions of DNA, however, the advent of miRNAs has opened a
new window of regulation. MiRNAs modulate the number of mRNAs by degrading
or suppressing the mRNAs, which have sites for binding of miRNAs in their 3’-UTR
regions (Ha and Kim 2014 ). There have also been reports of miRNA interactions
with other regions, namely, 5′-UTR, coding sequences, or gene promoters
(Broughton et al. 2016 ). The development of real-time PCR technology has favored
the detection of these small RNA molecules in very small quantities with higher
sensitivity and also helped in the identification of role of miRNAs in human
physiology.
A series of cleavage steps have been included in the canonical biogenesis of these
tiny regulatory molecules. Initially, Drosha and Di George Critical Region
8 (DGCR8) cleave primary (pri)-miRNA in the nucleus to generate precursor
(pre)-miRNA, which is then processed by Dicer in cytoplasm yielding double-
stranded miRNA. One strand of this complex is integrated into the RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC), which aids in the suppression of miRNA-driven genes
(Daugaard and Hansen 2017 ). Lin-4 was thefirst miRNA found inC. elegansin the
year 1993 (Iswariya et al. 2019 ). Presently, over 2000 miRNAs are estimated to be
expressed in humans, and more than 60% of genes encoding proteins possess a
minimum of one conserved miRNA-binding site. Many miRNAs show high con-
servation across species.
Ever since the discovery of these miRNA molecules, extensive research has been
conducted to gain an understanding of their role in multiple cellular pathways.
According to emerging evidence, the expression of mature miRNAs seems to play
a significant role in almost every known physiologic and pathologic process, such as
proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis (Pandey et al. 2015 ; Jauhari
et al. 2017 ; Jauhari and Yadav 2019 ). The expression of these mature miRNAs has
been shown to be dysregulated in numerous diseases such as cancer, hepatitis, and
cardiovascular disease (Xu et al. 2018 ). Further expression of these mature miRNAs
has provided an opportunity to develop novel and sensitive biomarkers for a variety
of diseases, which are usually detected late due to a lack of biomarkers (Pereira-da-
Silva et al. 2018 ). The presence of mature miRNAs has also been detected in
extracellular vesicles (EVs) like exosomes, which are derived from different tissues
in both normal and pathological conditions. Detection of mature miRNAs in tissue-
specific exosomes provides an opportunity to mirror the biochemical conditions of
organs in different pathological conditions, which will result in the development of
very specific and sensitive biomarkers. Extracellular miRNAs can also be
transported to target cells, where they function as autocrine, endocrine, and/or
paracrine regulators to govern cellular activity (Iftikhar and Carney 2016 ). Toll-
like receptors have also been reported to contain binding sites for extracellular
miRNAs (Fabbri 2018 ), which activate downstream signaling events and, in turn,
potentially trigger biological responses including tumor growth and metastasis
(Fabbri et al. 2012 ), and neurodegeneration (Lehmann et al. 2012 ). As a result,


9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 197

miRNAs also have the capability to function as chemical messengers in cell–cell
interaction.
The expression of mature miRNAs is linked with both age-related disorders and
ageing per se (Kogure et al. 2017 ). In Drosophila, miR-184 and let-7 are increased in
response to calorie restriction, whereas adult-specific upregulation of let-7 extends
the lifespan (Gendron and Pletcher 2017 ). According to miRNA profiling carried out
by Inukai and his team, the expression of 93 miRNAs has been found to change with
advancing age in the brain of aged mice (Inukai et al. 2012 ). Another study reported
that the miRNA cluster miR-183/96/182 is linked to age-linked memory loss, a
feature that can be reversed by overexpressing these miRNAs in the hippocampus
region (Jawaid et al. 2019 ). Furthermore, miR-302b-3p was upregulated in senescent
fibroblasts and aged skin of mice, implying that it was causally linked to ageing
because mimicking or inhibiting the miRNA enhanced or delayed the senescence of
skinfibroblasts, respectively (Tan et al.2020a, b). Similarly, miR-339 and miR-556
target Klotho, one of the proteins that help people live longer and whose levels
decline as they get older (Mehi et al. 2014 ). Studies conducted in the last few years
have also indicated a role of cell metabolism in age-associated diseases like
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) (Traxler et al. 2021 ). Suppression of gene expression
through an expression of miRNAs helps in regulating cellular metabolism, which
is related to ageing and development (Cassidy et al. 2019 ). In addition to regulating
their targets, miRNAs were reported to be controlled by numerous intrinsic factors,
and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are one of them. CircRNAs interact with miRNAs to
partly inhibit their activity, implying that they may have a role in gene and protein
expression. Through various miRNA-binding sites in the circular sequence, one
circRNA can regulate one or more miRNAs. Thefirst functioning circRNA, Human
CDR1as, has 74 binding sites for miR-7, 63 of which have been proven to be
conserved in at least one other species. CDR1as is abundant in neural tissues, and
knocking off CDR1as expression in mice or zebrafish hampers midbrain develop-
ment by disrupting miR-7 (Memczak et al. 2013 ). Another circRNA, i.e. circular
SRY has 16 binding sites and was shown to interact with miR-138 in HEK293 cells,
suggesting that SRY function as a sponge for miR-138 (Hansen et al. 2013 ).
The area of miRNA-based biomarkers and therapy has garnered a lot of interest in
recent years. The development of miRNA specificity and controlled delivery are two
current challenges. Understanding how miRNAs control cellular senescence and
organismal ageing will lay the groundwork for future investigations into the involve-
ment of miRNAs in better modulating and managing ageing and age-related dis-
eases. In the current chapter, we have attempted to understand the mechanism of
ageing by focusing on molecular changes and biomarkers of ageing as well as the
alteration in the miRNA profile of the brain, and other different tissues/organs during
ageing, the relevance of miRNAs in dicer knockdown, stem cell development, and in
various ageing diseases.

###### Ageing: Molecular Changes and Biomarkers

Ageing is a continuous multifactorial biological process that leads to progressive
decrease in systemic physiology due to damage at molecular, cellular, and tissue
levels. During ageing, several subcellular events inside the cell such as nucleus to
chromosome structure and organization, regulation of transcription, and nuclear
import/export, and all the way out to translation and protein quality control,
autophagic organelle recycling, and cytoskeletal structure maintenance deteriorate.
The proportion of people above 60 years is increasing worldwide, and they are
predicted to double by the year 2050, i.e., from 12% in 2015 to 22% in 2050 (Officer
et al. 2020 ). During the same period, the oldest-old (those aged 80 years and above)
are expected to increase by three times. An increase in the proportion of ageing
population raises several issues. Moreover, older people’s health varies greatly, with
few 80 years old individuals having the same physical and mental capability as many
20 years old, while others experience a declining trend in physical and mental
capabilities at a much younger age (Officer et al. 2020 ). The contributing factors
for this variation are complicated and unknown. As a result, there is a pressing
demand to improve our knowledge of the underlying pathways of ageing, so that the
continuous increase in percentage of aged people in the population is helpful to
future societies. Few molecular changes are considered as“hallmarks of ageing”like
Genomic instability, epigenetic modifications, telomere shortening, proteostasis
impairment, mitochondrial failure, cellular senescence, deregulation of nutrient-
sensing mechanisms, stem cell depletion, and changes in intercellular signaling
pathways (López-Otín et al. 2013 ).
Genomic instability results from the accumulation of unrepaired DNA, which is
caused either by increased DNA damage or failure of DNA repair (Vijg and Suh
2013 ). Endogenous risks such as DNA replication abnormalities, reactions involving
spontaneous hydrolysis, UV light, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and irradiation
constantly challenge the integrity and stability of DNA, however, presence of
optimally functional DNA repair machinery keeps correcting the damages
(Hoeijmakers 2009 ). The causative or effect relationship between genome instability
and ageing is still debatable (Vijg and Suh 2013 ). Studies have shown the role of
dietary restriction in delaying genome instability during ageing (Dempsey et al.
1993 ; Garcia et al. 2008 ). A complex vice versa relationship has been observed
between genomic instability and regulation of the transcription of genes. Due to the
multiple indirect impacts of DNA damage on gene transcription, the correlations
identified between DNA damage, repair, and transcription are extremely complex
(Khobta and Epe 2012 ). A meta-analysis carried out using data from 36 studies has
identified an association between DNA damage and ageing in humans (Soares et al.
2014 ). Cells obtained from elderly humans and model organisms accumulate
somatic mutations (Moskalev et al. 2013 ). DNA damage in other forms, like
chromosomal abnormalities (aneuploidy) and variations in copy number, has also
been associated with ageing (Faggioli et al. 2012 ). Studies have shown that tran-
scription is gaining prominence as a significant endogenous regulator of DNA


9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 199

damage in cells, which can also result in alterations of miRNA expression (Khobta
and Epe 2012 ).
Telomeres, also known as the chromatin tips, are responsible for preventing
chromosomal end shortening. These telomeres shorten with age and become more
vulnerable to damage (McHugh and Gil 2018 ). Telomere-induced senescence of
postmitotic cells has recently been recognized as a key trigger of ageing (von
Zglinicki et al. 2021 ). Employing Mendelian-randomization examination of the
UK Biobank data, a potential causal relation between short genetically determined
telomere length (gTLs) and accelerated facial ageing was reported (Zhan and Hägg
2021 ). Defects in the telomerase complex lead to various age-related pathologies in
humans, including premature greying of the hair, lungfibrosis, liver disorder, and
aplastic anemia (Armanios and Blackburn 2012 ). However, human telomere short-
ening may be slowed or reversed with gene therapy encoding telomerase compo-
nents (Ramunas et al. 2015 ).
Epigenetic changes (phenotypic alterations which are not induced by mutations in
DNA sequence) occurring with ageing are substantially correlated with modifica-
tions of DNA and chromatin organization like reduction in global heterochromatin,
generalized hypomethylation of DNA, and hypermethylation of CpG island,
remodeling of nucleosome, changes in histone marks, etc. (Teumer et al. 2016 ).
Employing various cell types and tissues, large-scale genome-wide DNA
methylation-based epigenetic analyses have identified a correlation between healthy
ageing and“epigenetic clock’(Horvath 2013 ). At gene level, age-related epigenetic
markers include enhanced acetylation of H4K16 and trimethylation of H3K4 and
H4K20, along with reduced methylation and trimethylation of H3K9 and H3K27,
respectively (Han and Brunet 2012 ).
Proteostasis (homeostasis of cellular proteins) management becomes weak with
age. Preserving the proteome’s integrity can help in delaying and reducing ageing-
associated changes (Labbadia and Morimoto 2015 ). Two types of proteolytic path-
ways are implicated in the breakdown and clearance of unrequired proteins: the
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagosomal–lysosomal pathway,
both of which lose their effectiveness with increasing age (Press et al. 2019 ). DAF-2,
an insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor coding gene inCaenorhabditis
elegansregulates longevity through proteostasis (Matilainen et al. 2013 ). Further-
more, the repression observed in the expression of ATP-dependent chaperones
during ageing also indicates that protein misfolding and aggregation promote ageing
(Brehme et al. 2014 ). Misfolded aggregates of proteins are observed in the brain of
age-associated disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease
(PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Nutrient sensing and signaling have also been reported to govern ageing in
eukaryotes ranging from yeast to humans. An interplay has been reported between
nutrient sensing/caloric restriction and ageing, as well as the role of caloric restric-
tion in extending longevity in murine and non-human primate models (Vermeij et al.
2016 ). The kinase target of rapamycin (TOR), AMP kinase (AMPK), sirtuins, and
insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signaling are some of the nutrient-sensing
pathways identified to have a role in longevity (Pan and Finkel 2017 ). Several


200 S. Yadav et al.

proteins of the mTOR pathway have also been shown to be deregulated in elderly
humans (Papadopoli et al. 2019 ). AMPK signaling is also involved in the age-related
reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis, which regulates cognitive impairment in
humans (Wang et al.2019a). Human genome-wide association study (GWAS)
showed variants related to low serum IGF-1 have also been linked with a higher
possibility of living beyond 90 years of age (Teumer et al. 2016 ). Overall, the
evidence available in the literature suggests that higher anabolic signaling promotes
ageing, while reduced nutrient signaling prolongs lifespan.
Dysfunction of mitochondria is another common feature of aged cells (Bratic and
Larsson 2013 ). The decreased efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation in aged cells
results in lower ATP production and insufficient supply of energy to the cells. The
impaired mitochondrial function leads to an ageing phenotype, particularly in organs
that necessitate a massive amount of energy, including the heart, muscles, brain, and
liver. Studies have demonstrated that ageing alters the regulation of mPTP (mito-
chondrial permeability transition pore) opening in mitochondria obtained from
several aged/senescent tissues (Picard et al. 2011 ; Shum et al. 2016 ). Reduction of
mitochondrial stress (or activation of the mitohormetic response), extends lifespan in
a wide range of animal models, which range from worms to mammals (Cox et al.
2018 ).
Cellular senescence is irreversible and kind of irreversible cell cycle arrest
resulting due to telomere erosion, triggering of DNA damage response, oxidative
stress, and increased transcription of oncogenes. The abnormal buildup of senescent
cells with increasing age can have detrimental effects (McHugh and Gil 2018 ). Key
players in this phase include p53, p16, and p21 (Lidzbarsky et al. 2018 ).
Stem cell exhaustion or unavailability of stem cells, when required by different
tissues during ageing, is also considered one of the primary causes of increased
ageing. Many of the physical problems associated with ageing, such as compromised
tissue regenerative potential, frailty, and a weakened immune system, are caused due
to exhaustion of stem cells (Ren et al. 2017 ). Adult stem cells are maintained
virtually in all tissues and organs, including the forebrain, muscle, and bone (Conboy
and Rando 2012 ). Aged Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) exhibit increased repli-
cative stress upon cycling and decreased ribosomal biogenesis (Flach et al. 2014 ).
Autophagy impairment has also been linked with a reduction in stem cell activity in
current research on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and muscle stem cells (MSCs)
(Cao et al. 2015 ; García-Prat et al. 2017 ). These results indicated that MSCs and
HSCs lose their regenerative potential as they age and that ageing stem cells have
autophagy defects. Recent promising research shows that rejuvenation of stem cells
may reverse the ageing phenotype and provide a thrilling avenue for the treatment of
age-linked degenerative ailments (Wang and Xie 2014 ; Bengal et al. 2017 ).
However, apart from cell-autonomous changes, ageing also includes alterations
in intercellular signaling pathways, whether endocrine, neuroendocrine, or neuronal
(Laplante and Sabatini 2012 ; Zhang et al. 2013 ). Increased inflammatory response,
also known as“inflammaging,” and disruption of cytokine expression are two
common ageing-related changes in intercellular communication. Defective inflam-
matory responses are implicated in age-related diseases like obesity and diabetes


9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 201

type 2 (Barzilai et al. 2012 ). Zhang and colleagues published a study suggesting that
the hypothalamus modulates systemic ageing by combining NF-kB-driven inflam-
matory reactions with GnRH-driven neuroendocrine responses (Zhang et al. 2013 )
(Table9.1).

###### Biomarkers of Ageing

Because ageing is a multifaceted process that involves complex interactions between
molecular and biological pathways, a single or easily defined group of biomarkers is
unlikely to offer a reliable assessment of biological ageing. As a result, there is no
standard diagnostic tool for detecting healthy ageing, and no single parameter has yet
been identified as a reliable and sensitive ageing biomarker. Many researchers
suggest that a combination of biomarkers should be taken into consideration to
accurately envisage ageing-associated outcomes (Earls et al. 2019 ; Kudryashova
et al. 2020 ). Ageing biomarkers can be developed using phenotypic data or labora-
tory observations. Among the phenotypic biomarkers of ageing, physical properties,
and anthropometry are the most commonly adopted measurements. Walking speed,
grip strength, standing balance, chair stand, BMI, waist size, and muscle mass are all
recognized indicators of ageing determination (Wagner et al. 2016 ).
Telomere length is a commonly discussed ageing biomarker (Vaiserman and
Krasnienkov 2020 ). Kahl & Allen et al. summarized various telomere length mea-
surement methods, including imaging-based methods Telomere length Combing
Assay (TCA), Quantitative-Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (Q-FISH, Flow-
FISH), Terminal Restriction Fragment (TRF) as well as PCR-based techniques
(Kahl et al. 2020 ). The degree of DNA damage, particularly, mitochondrial DNA
damage, is a primary contributor to mitochondrial impairment and is another
DNA-associated possible biomarker of ageing (Dodig et al. 2019 ). Exosomes,
ectosomes, and apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) are some of the circulating biomarkers
based on extracellular vesicles (EVs) being investigated for predicting
age-associated disorders (Kalluri and LeBleu 2020 ; Noren Hooten 2020 ). Further-
more, alterations in the skin microbiome’s community constitution have also been
linked to age (Kim et al. 2019 ), and more accurate data is gathered when the gut
microbiota is considered (Askarova et al. 2020 ).
One of the most well-studied ageing biomarkers is alterations in methylation
patterns of DNA, as assessed by the epigenetic clock (Bell et al. 2019 ). Noncoding
RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNA), are also employed to predict age-linked
disorders and are frequently extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) (Kumar et al. 2017 ). A few of the age-regulated miRNAs identified in
several studies are miR-34a, miR-132, miR-9, miR-212, miR-145, miR-21, and
miR-96 (Halper et al. 2015 ; Budzinska et al. 2016 ; Owczarz et al. 2017 ; Hadar
et al. 2018 ).

In the past few years, the detection and characterization of cellular senescence
biomarkers as ageing markers has garnered considerable attention.
Senescence-associated-galactosidase (SA-gal) (Hernandez-Segura et al. 2018 ) and
p16INK4A (Vandenberk et al. 2011 ) are the most commonly used markers. Trig-
gered and constitutive DNA damage response (DDR), reduced telomere length and
malfunction, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) are other
senescent cell markers. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is
characterized by the elevation of multiple inflammatory markers in serum or EDTA
plasma of probands employing the readily available ELISA technique (Hernandez-
Segura et al. 2018 ; Tanaka et al. 2018 ).
Ageing biomarkers are multilayered and multifunctional, with a bewildering
array of factors, as one would expect considering the complexity of the ageing
process. However, an artificial intelligence software capable of forecasting a per-
son’s life expectancy on the basis of quantitative data in a vast panel of ageing
biomarkers would not be out of the realm of possibility.

###### Ageing and Dicer Gene Ablation Studies

Ageing is a progressive change in cellular, biochemical, physiological, and morpho-
logical statuses of the body, which can be measured by nine hallmark changes, i.e.,
instability in genomic DNA, epigenetic alterations, telomere shortening, altered
nutrient sensing, proteostasis failure, mitochondrial malfunction, stem cell exhaus-
tion, cellular senescence, and impaired intercellular communication. The Dicer is a
large (200 kDa) protein from the RNase III family that recognizes double-stranded
RNAs and degrades them under cellular conditions. It was discovered inDrosophila
melanogasterbut is well-conserved among all eukaryotic organisms. Dicer cuts as
the scissor to generate mature miRNAs from precursor miRNAs (Piroozian et al.
2019 ). It is suggested that in absence of Dicer genes, no miRNA will mature in the
functional form.
The DICER1 gene participates in the DNA Damage Response (DDR) signaling
by processing dsRNA, which is required for repairing double-strand breaks in DNA.
This process appears to be required to retard telomere shortening, which is a
hallmark of ageing (Rossiello et al. 2017 ). Furthermore, DICER1 loss has been
linked to epigenetic alterations in mammalian cells including DNA methylation,
histone modification, and chromatin remodeling (Haussecker and Proudfoot 2005 ;
Chitale andRichly 2017 ).Interestingly, all of the ageing hallmarks can be influenced
in absence of Dicer gene, not only by impairment in miRNA maturation but also by
altered noncanonical DICER activities (López-Otín et al. 2013 ).
DICER1 depletion in adipocytes has been demonstrated to over-activate the
sensing signaling molecule mTORC1 (Reis et al. 2016 ). It also decreases mitochon-
drial counts, which are irregularly structured and linked to decreased oxidative
metabolism following caloric restriction, which is known as one of the most
effective interventions for delaying ageing and the beginning of age-associated
disorders (Reis et al. 2016 ). Previously, our group has reported that knockdown of
the dicer gene in PC12 cells impairs their differentiation capacity resulting in
NGF-differentiated neurons with shorter neurites and a greater number of neurites
in comparison to the control group (Pandey et al. 2015 ). The production of numerous
nuclei, which is frequent in senescent cells, was also reported in dicer-silenced
neurons (Pandey et al. 2015 ). Another study from our lab found that decreased
dicer levels drive differentiating SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to enter senescence
(Jauhari et al. 2017 ). Dietary restriction has been reported in studies to prevent the
age-related reduction of Dicer in murine white adipose tissue (WAT), thus reverting
a global drop in miRNAs expression that arises with ageing (Mori et al. 2012 ).
In both humans and mice, Dicer gene levels in adipose tissue are reduced with
obesity and lipodystrophy (Mori et al. 2014 ; Oliverio et al. 2016 ; Torriani et al.
2016 ). Adipose-specific Dicer knockout mice (Adicer KO) develop severe obesity-
and age-related insulin resistance and a large proportion of these mice die prema-
turely, implying that Dicer downregulation in adipose tissue contributes to ageing
and age-linked T2D (Mori et al. 2014 ; Oliverio et al. 2016 ; Reis et al. 2016 ). Dicer
levels inC. elegansare also affected by ageing and dietary restriction, a phenomenon


9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 205

that is also reported in mouse adipose tissue (Mori et al. 2012 ). Worms
overexpressing Dicer in the intestine, which is analogous to adipose tissue in
mammals, are stress-resistant, but worms with whole-body Dicer loss-of-function
mutations die early (Mori et al. 2012 ). Furthermore, the downregulation Interleukin
8 (IL-8) gene in endothelial cells following the knockdown of DICER1 (Suárez et al.
2007 ) demonstrates the possible role of this multifaceted enzyme in another ageing
feature, which is cellular communication.
As people age, the gene DICER is shown to be decreased in different tissues,
including the heart, adipose tissue, and brain (Mori et al. 2012 ; Boon et al. 2013 ).
Long-term cellular stress is assumed to be the source of age-linked reduction in
Dicer activity (Kaneko et al. 2011 ; Emde and Hornstein 2014 ), resulting in
decreased miRNA processing and lowering of mature miRNA levels (Mori et al.
2012 ; Dimmeler and Nicotera 2013 ). Expression profiling data of miRNAs revealed
a consistent decrease in miRNA levels in the aged mouse brain (Inukai et al. 2012 ).
A reduction in the level of Dicer gene has also been found in dopaminergic nerve
cells from Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients (Simunovic et al. 2010 ). In vivo
research has demonstrated that Dicer deletion in dopaminergic neurons accelerates
cell death and leads to increased degeneration of their axonal extensions present in
the striatum, thus mimicking the cell death pattern seen in clinical PD. Dicer ablation
of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in mice lead to progressive deficits in balance and
motor coordination, eventually leading to the development of a PD-like phenotype
(Chmielarz et al. 2017 ; Guo et al. 2020 ). The Dicer1 gene is disrupted in embryonic
DA neurons, which disrupts the DA system’s development (Kim et al. 2014 ).
Furthermore, Dicer deficiency leads to a number of PD symptoms, which include
resting tremors, posture-related and gait difficulties, and stiffness. Nevertheless,
increased Dicer function in these mice through treatment with enoxacin—a medi-
cation that stimulates Dicer activity—proved to be neuroprotective, revealing the
important involvement of Dicer in the onset and development of this age-related
disease (Chmielarz et al. 2017 ).
Reduced expression of mature miRNAs triggered by a malfunction in miRNA
biogenesis mechanisms is witnessed in motor neurons of patients with ALS, as well
as in cells following exposure to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or oxidative stress
(Emde et al. 2015 ). Dicer expression in the hypothalamus also declines with age,
resulting in the differentiation of Pomc-expressing progenitors into AgRP/NPY
phenotypes and subsequent metabolic dysfunction, which could be regulated by
miR-107/103 (Croizier et al. 2018 ). As a result, Dicer could be a promising candi-
date for therapy or management of symptoms associated with age-related
pathologies.
The circadian pattern of Dicer was lost/downregulated as a consequence of
ageing and diabetes, and these implications were clearly displayed in the circadian
patterns of Dicer-controlled essential RNAs, miRNAs, and toxic Alu RNA (Yan
et al. 2013 ). Dicer levels were reported to be decreased in the macular retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE), which is an eye-specific pluripotent tissue that is
impaired in Geographic atrophy (GA), an advanced form of age-linked macular
degeneration (Kaneko et al. 2011 ; Meister 2011 ). Dicer knockdown resulted in


206 S. Yadav et al.

increased cell death in mice and human RPE cells, indicating that Dicer
dysregulation is implicated in disease etiology (Kaneko et al. 2011 ). When com-
pared to centenarians, octogenarians have a global decline in the expression of
miRNAs and also reduced the production of miRNA biogenesis factors like
DICER1 in the blood cells of humans (Serna et al. 2012 ; Borrás et al. 2017 ).
There is also mounting evidence suggesting that the expression of miRNA and
Dicer1 in the liver may change as mammals age (Bates et al. 2010 ). Age-linked
oxidative stress and Dicer1 downregulation are found to be involved in the
dysregulation of miRNAs in aged cerebral microvascular endothelial cells
(CMVECs). The discovery that increased expression of Dicer1 in elderly CMVECs
elevated the expression of age-sensitive miRNAs lends support to this theory.
Moreover, Dicer1 knockdown resulted in miRNA downregulation, mimicking the
ageing phenotype (Ungvari et al. 2013 ).
Owing to its diverse and pleiotropic functions, the precise evaluation of the
numerous roles of DICER1 seems to be a difficult task. Moreover, the factors that
regulate DICER1 gene levels in specific cells and at different phases of development
remain unknown. Besides that, the levels of DICER1 mRNA and protein levels are
not always found to correlate (Kurzynska-Kokorniak et al. 2015 ), which adds yet
another layer of complication. Furthermore, post-translational modifications (PTMs)
such as SUMOylation and phosphorylation appear to control DICER1 activity
(Gross et al. 2014 ), and the protein molecules can shuttle between the nucleus and
the cytoplasm, performing various functions in each compartment based on interac-
tions with numerous cofactors. The most perceptible series of processes in which
Dicer is likely to participate in the development of ageing-related pathologies are
likely deregulation of miRNA expression. Despite the abundance of data already
gathered in this area, there are still a number of unexplored possibilities for future
research. The discovery of novel regulatory domains, single nucleotide polymor-
phism (SNPs), and mutations, and also the characterization of cell- and tissue-
specific Dicer activities, will almost certainly characterize future research into
biological functions of Dicer in ageing and ageing-related abnormalities. In-depth
research of the biological pathways underlying ageing pathologies may identify
potential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, leading to introduction of more
efficacious and novel Dicer-dependent diagnostic and treatment approaches, likely
to result in a variety of clinical advantages and improved quality of life for patients.

###### miRNAs Identified for their Role in Ageing of Different

###### Tissues/Organs

Substantial evidence has revealed the involvement of mature miRNA expression in
apoptosis, senescence, and ageing of cells of different origins (Kinser and Pincus
2020 ). The common link between apoptosis, senescence, and ageing of cells is their
acceleration in cellular stress conditions. In a way, all three processes are a method to
go away from proliferation and stop the normal metabolism of cells. Based on this,


9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 207

we can expect some similarities in molecular changes occurring in cells undergoing
apoptosis, senescence, and ageing. Unlike apoptotic cells, senescent and ageing cells
are viable and have the capacity to secrete soluble factors or extracellular vesicles
like exosomes, which can be used to monitor them and understand their molecular
mechanism of action. Studies have provided a substantial amount of evidence that
both senescent and ageing cells express mature and functional miRNAs, which are
involved in inhibiting the protein synthesis of genes not required by these cells (Lai
et al. 2019 ). Furthermore, deregulated expression of mature miRNAs has been
identified in all ageing-associated diseases like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, diabetes,
cardiovascular, cancers, and metabolic disorders (de Lucia et al. 2017 ; Sandiford
et al. 2018 ;Juźwik et al. 2019 ; Saul and Kosinsky 2021 ).

###### Muscle Ageing and miRNAs

Gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and functions are hallmarks of ageing
in humans. Degeneration of muscles with age is termed sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is a
syndrome characterized by impaired balance, falls, frailty, reduction in physical
activity, and increased susceptibility of aged people to lifelong disability, metabolic
diseases, and other ageing disorders (Kinser and Pincus 2020 ). Causes of sarcopenia
are multifactorial like long-term persisting inflammation, hormonal imbalance, mus-
clefiber denervation, oxidative stress, abnormalities of muscle stem/progenitor cells,
and cellular senescence (Hu et al. 2014 ). Drummond et al. were thefirst to demon-
strate a change in miRNA profile during sarcopenia in humans (Drummond et al.
2008 ). They have concluded that ageing is linked with higher miRNA levels in basal
skeletal muscle and also the expression level of miRNAs is dysregulated after
anabolic stimulus (Drummond et al. 2008 ).
Hamrick et al. have performed global miRNA profiling using Taqman Array
cards and identified alteration in the expression of 57 miRNAs with ageing in mice
(Hamrick et al. 2010 ). Also, they have found significant upregulation in the expres-
sion miR-7, miR-468, miR-698, and miR-542 and a significant decrease in the
expression of miR-181a, miR-124a, miR-221, miR-434, miR-382, and miR-455 in
muscles of ageing mouse (Hamrick et al. 2010 ). Furthermore, they have also studied
the effect of body weight regulating hormone leptin (secreted from fat cells and
muscles) on muscle mass in ageing mice and identified dysregulation of 37 miRNAs,
out of which three deregulated miRNAs in aged mice, namely, miR-685, miR-155,
and miR-142-3p were reversed (Hamrick et al. 2010 ). The expression of miR-221 is
altered during myogenesis and is involved in the transition of myoblasts to myocytes
as well as in the attainment of a fully differentiated phenotype (Cardinali et al. 2009 ).
In addition, a microarray profiling study carried out in human skeletal muscle has
identified significant upregulation in eight miRNAs (let-7a,-b,-e, and -f, as well as
miR-98, miR-25, miR-1268, and miR-195) and downregulation in ten miRNAs
(miR-22, miR-24, miR-27b, miR-27a, miR-30d, miR-133b, miR-133a, miR-378,
miR-223, and miR-378*) in muscles of aged individuals in comparison to young


208 S. Yadav et al.

counterparts. The same study has suggested that increased expression of members of
Let-7 family may effectively downregulate genes linked with cellular proliferation
and identified miR-7 family as a determinant of impeded cell activity, potentially
contributing to reduced renewal and regeneration of human muscle cells during
ageing (Drummond et al. 2011 ).
Another group of scientists studied the effect of resistance exercise on the
expression level of miRNAs in skeletal muscle. They discovered that 26 miRNAs
were identified to be differentially expressed in aged compared to young muscles.
The Akt-mTOR signaling pathway was expected to be targeted by nine miRNAs
from the miR-99/100 family, suggesting the family’s involvement in the regulation
of muscle mass during the ageing process (Zacharewicz et al. 2014 ). A set of
miRNAs, such as miR-434-3p, miR-181a, miR-431, miR-126, and miR-29 has
been identified to have a key role in the pathophysiology of sarcopenia, regulating
pathways such as senescence, apoptosis, and IGF-1 signaling in aged muscle cells
(Rivas et al. 2014 ). MiR-181a downregulation with age has been shown in studies to
be an effective mechanism to combat muscle atrophy; interestingly, in primates, this
downregulation is reversed by calorie restriction, which probably reflects delayed
muscle ageing (Mercken et al. 2013 ). Sirt1, a direct target of miR-181a, has its
protein expression level altered in skeletal muscle from aged mice; miR-181a: Sirt1
interactions govern myotube size in C2C12 myotubes in vitro (Soriano-Arroquia
et al. 2016 ).
MiR-434-3p expression in mouse skeletal muscle has also been reported to
decline with age (Hamrick et al. 2010 ; Jung et al. 2017 ; Pardo et al. 2017 ), and
this dysregulation may contribute to muscle loss by increasing apoptosis via dere-
pression of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (Eif5a1), a pro-apoptotic gene (Pardo
et al. 2017 ). Another study discovered that miR-431 is downregulated in myoblasts
from older mice in comparison to younger mice (Lee et al. 2015 ). Smad4, a
component of the SMAD transcriptional complex that has been shown to inhibit
muscle cell regenerative capacity, is one of the miR-431 targets. Furthermore,
studies of Hutchinson–Gilford using the progeria mouse model found that miR-29
is increased during progeroid and normal ageing (Ugalde et al. 2011 ; Hu et al. 2014 )
and that this rise in miR-29 levels triggers senescence and suppresses the prolifer-
ation of muscle cells in young skeletal muscle via inhibition of several signaling
proteins, including Igf1, P85, and B-myb (Hu et al. 2014 ).

###### Bone Ageing and miRNAs

Osteoporosis, which is thought to be primarily age-related and is characterized by
bone loss and vulnerability to fragility fractures have a higher incidence rate in aged
peoples (He et al. 2013 ). It has been shown by several studies that miRNAs are key
players in bone metabolism, alteration of which results in osteoporosis (Feng et al.
2018 ). Li et al. were thefirst to provide substantial data on the role of miRNAs
(miR-2861) in the differentiation of osteoblast and osteoporosis through its impact


9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 209

on osteoblasts and posttranscriptional inhibition of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5)
(Li et al. 2009 ). Overexpression of a neural development regulating miRNAs viz.,
miR-34c has also been linked with age-dependent osteoporosis in mice (Bae et al.
2012 ). The involvement of miR-21 in bone diseases and bone ageing has been
reported by several labs and the same has been thoroughly revived by Chen and
colleagues (Chen et al. 2021 ). A downregulation in miR-21 expression was reported
in bones of aged mice, which caused osteocyte death via upregulating levels of a
pro-apoptotic gene known as PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) (Davis et al.
2017b). In vivo studies have demonstrated that miR-21 promotes osteoblast devel-
opment and bone formation and its expression downregulates in mesenchymal stem
cells of bone marrow and people with osteoporosis (Yang et al. 2013 ). MiR-21 has
been reported to protect against osteoporosis by inhibiting Reck, a negative regulator
of osteogenesis-related matrix metalloproteinases (Zhao et al.2015b). Further,
knocking out miR-21 has been shown to protect against bone loss as well as bone
resorption during both normal ageing and ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis by
targeting Pdcd4 gene (Hu et al. 2017 ).
A miR-183 cluster member (i.e., miR-183-5p) is found in a very high amount in
extracellular vesicles (EVs) collected from aged mouse blood (Davis et al.2017a).
Further, when these EVs are taken up by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) of
young mice, miR-183-5p suppresses BMSC cellular proliferation and the formation
of bones (Davis et al.2017a). Osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of
nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) increased miR-183 expression in bone marrow-
derived macrophages (BMMs) (Ke et al. 2015 ). A miRNA known for its involve-
ment in the regulation of senescence, i.e., miR-31, has been shown to inhibit
osteogenic differentiation by targeting frizzled Class Receptor 3 (Fzd3), a Wnt
Family Member 5A (Wnt5a) (Weilner et al. 2016 ). The expression level of
miR-31 increases with advancing age in human plasma and osteoporotic males
compared to healthy counterparts (Weilner et al. 2016 ). The expression level of
miR-214 also upregulates in osteoporotic human and mouse bone and suppresses
osteoblast function and mineralization by targeting Atf-4 (Wang et al. 2013 ).
Additionally,inhibiting miR-214 in osteoblasts from old ovariectomy-induced oste-
oporotic mice leads to improvement in bone mass and architecture, and also boosts
new bone formation (Wang et al. 2013 ). In contrast, miR-214 overexpression in
osteoclasts in vivo results in greater osteoclast activity and bone loss (Zhao et al.
2015a). In ovariectomized mice that are getting older, osteoclast-derived exosomal
miR-214 has been shown to function as a key player in inhibiting osteoblast function
and bone formation (Zhao et al.2015a; Sun et al. 2016 ). In human BMSCs, miR-188
regulates the bone metabolism genes, i.e., Rictor and Hdac9, by triggering PPARy,
an adipocyte differentiation transcription factor, which promotes differentiation of
BMSC into adipocytes instead of osteoblasts (Li et al. 2015 ). When compared to
wild-type mice, elderly miR-188 knockout mice showed higher osteoblastic bone
production, lesser bone loss, and low-fat buildup in the bone marrow (Li et al.2015).
Moreover,there was no difference in young animals between the two backgrounds,
implying that miR-188 functions specifically during the ageing process (Li et al.
2015 ). Like miR-188, miR-218 is a direct regulator of Rictor gene and is


210 S. Yadav et al.

predominantly expressed in older mouse BMSCs; however, instead of altering
differentiation, miR-218 accelerates bone loss via decreasing osteoblast adhesion
and survival, inhibiting the production of new bone (Lai et al. 2016 ).

###### Heart Ageing and miRNAs

Ageing also affects cardiac function substantially and with ageing the risk of
developing cardiovascular diseases increases dramatically. Like other organs, car-
diac ageing is also a complex process, and the advent of noncoding RNAs has
brought unprecedented molecular insights into the process. Boon et al. ( 2013 )
discovered that miR-34a is involved in ageing-induced cardiac degeneration, a
miRNA that is also known to regulate bone and neuronal ageing process. In cardiac
ageing, expression of miR-34 is linked with decreased expression of its downstream
target protein phosphatase Pnuts, an apoptosis inhibitor, and in vivo inhibition or
genetic deletion of miR-34a decreases age-related cardiomyocyte cell death by
regulating telomere attrition and DNA damage responses. Thesefindings suggest
that miR-34a could possess great therapeutic potential in the context of heart ageing
(Boon et al. 2013 ). In adult mice, miR-34a antagonists improved post-MI cardiac
function via modulating cell cycle and survival proteins such as Cyclin D1, Bcl2,
and Sirt1 (Yang et al. 2015 ). In transgenic mice and the mouse cardiacfibroblast
(MCF) cell model, the transgenic expression of miR-17-3p extended survival and
retarded senescence by targeting Par-4, a pro-apoptotic protein, and promoting the
CEBPB/FAK senescence-associated signaling pathway (Du et al. 2015 ). The expres-
sion level of miR-22 also increases with advancing age in cardiac tissues of both
mice and humans (Jazbutyte et al. 2013 ; Gupta et al. 2016 ). Silencing of Mimecan
gene (also known as osteoglycin) and overexpression of miR-22 contributed to a
considerable increase in the number of senescent cells in cardiacfibroblasts, indi-
cating that miR-22 has a pro-ageing effect (Jazbutyte et al. 2013 ). Furthermore,
inhibiting miR-22 lowers hypertrophy and triggers myocardial autophagy in elderly
rat cardiomyocytes, both are important for preserving cardiac activity as people age
(Gupta et al. 2016 ).
In other research using mice with a heart failure-resistant (C57Bl6) and heart
failure-prone (C57Bl6 129Sv) genetic background found that miR-19a and miR-18a
were significantly inhibited in aged cardiomyocytes, with concomitantly elevated
production of ECM proteins such as thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and connective
tissue growth factor (CTGF) (van Almen et al. 2011 ). MiR-21 was more abundant in
the cardiac tissues of elderly mice in comparison to young mice (Zhang et al. 2012 ),
anditsexpression is greatly enhanced by TGF-1βin the post-MI (myocardial
infarction) zone (Yuan et al. 2017 ; Zhou et al. 2018 ). Patients with aortic stenosis-
inducedfibrosis and acute MI have both been successfully identified by measuring
the level of circulating miR-21 (Villar et al. 2013 ) (Zhang et al.2016c). It was
recently discovered that miR-21 promotes doxorubicin (DOX)-induced senescence
in cardiomyocytes, probably via targeting the phosphatase and Tensin homolog, and


9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 211

that silencing of miR-21 has been shown to prevent this senescence (Bei et al. 2018 ).
Expression of miR-29 has also been significantly upregulated in the ageing heart as it
is reported in ageing brain. During ageing in the heart ventricle, miR-29a and
SERPINH1 (a particular procollagen chaperone) have a direct negative correlation
(Rusu-Nastase et al. 2021 ). The accumulation of oxidative stress in the body as we
age has been reported to regulate the miR-29 family, providing a preventive strategy
against cardiacfibrosis (Heid et al. 2017 ). miR-1468-3p was found to promote
cardiacfibrosis and cell senescence by increasing transforming growth factor b1
(TGF-b1)-P38 signaling (Lin et al. 2020 ).

###### Skin Ageing and miRNAs

Undoubtedly, skin is the body’sfirst line of defense in response to biotic and abiotic
environmental stimuli (Choi and Lee 2015 ; Lämmermann et al. 2018 ). Symptoms
and severity of ageingfirst become visible on the skin, which is the ultimate
multitasking and vital organ and protective layer in mammals. However, it is difficult
to define the amount or severity of ageing by the appearance of skin. Despite a
continuous renewal process, the regenerative capacity of cutaneous layer declines
with the increase in age. Eventually, a decrease in regenerative potential results in
decreased removal of senescent cells, and their progressive buildup leads to physi-
ological ageing of the skin (Mancini et al. 2014 ). There are many unanswered
questions about healthy ageing and achieving longevity. Skin can act as an ideal
health sensor as changes in its appearance signal the organism’s ongoing patholog-
ical alterations (ElSharawy et al. 2012 ). By understanding dermal health and the
effect of ageing at molecular levels, skin can be crucial in the management of ageing
and its effect. The expression of mature miRNAs in governing the development and
homeostasis of skin has been reported by several studies, which reveal the molecular
mechanism of skin ageing.
Keratinocytes are the primary and outermost layer of the cells found in the
epidermis. One of thefirst researches on senescent skin cells discovered a set of
126 senescence-associated miRNAs in senescent normal human keratinocytes (Shin
et al. 2011 ). Among the 126 senescence-linked miRNAs, 9 (7%) have shown
downregulation and 117 (93%) have shown upregulation (Shin et al. 2011 ). During
replicative cellular senescence, miR-137 and miR-668 were increased in particular,
which induced senescence in proliferating human keratinocytes via triggering the
senescence markers p53 and p16INK4A proteins (Shin et al. 2011 ). Rivetti and
colleagues have identified upregulation in the expression of miR-138, miR-181a/b,
and miR-130b in keratinocytes undergoing replicative senescence (Rivetti di Val
Cervo et al. 2012 ). They observed that these four miRNAs altered cell proliferation
pathways by targeting the p63 and Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) genes (Rivetti di Val Cervo
et al. 2012 ). Earlier studies have shown that levels of Sirt1 proteins help to increase
mammalian lifespan, while its knockdown leads to cellular senescence (Rivetti di
Val Cervo et al. 2012 ; Teumer et al. 2016 ; Korman 2019 ). The involvement of


212 S. Yadav et al.

miR-130b in regulating p63 gene has been reported by several labs (Rivetti di Val
Cervo et al. 2012 ; Dong et al. 2013 ). The P63 gene encodes a transcription factor
belonging to the p53 family, which is vital for epithelial development and p63
proteins can also prevent cellular senescence and ageing (Mancini et al. 2014 ).
Moreover, studies have demonstrated that levels of p63 proteins inhibit the expres-
sion of miRNAs involved in inducing senescence, namely miRNA-138, miR-130b,
miRNA-181a, and miRNA-181b (Rivetti di Val Cervo et al. 2012 ).
Lena and colleagues reported upregulation of miR-191 during keratinocyte
senescence, and overexpression of miR-192 inhibits growth and limits SA-beta-
galactosidase activity by regulating the expression of CDK6 and SATB1 genes
(Lena et al. 2012 ). The expression of miR-191 inhibits the transition from G1 to S
phase by regulating the levels of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase 6 (CDK6)
gene. This obstruction manifests as a cell cycle arrest which leads to the progression
of senescence conditions. Likewise, miR-191 reduces the mRNA of SATB1 (special
adenine- and thymine-rich binding protein 1), which is coupled with an upsurge in
senescence-related markers (Lena et al. 2012 ). SATB1 functions as a docking site for
enzymes involved in chromatin remodeling, as well as a direct recruiter of HDACs
(corepressors) or HATs (coactivators) to promoters (Pavan Kumar et al. 2006 ).
Another study has demonstrated that miR-191 also inhibits the proliferation of
primary humanfibroblasts via targeting CDK9, NOTCH2, and RPS6KA3 genes
(Polioudakis et al. 2015 ). The 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) is the main
enzyme that coordinates the elimination of 8-OH-dG lesions by the primary step
involved in the repair process, and its expression level in keratinocytes drops
dramatically with age (Tinaburri et al. 2018 ). In silico studies of 3’-UTR of the
OGG1 gene indicated the existence of binding sites of miR-33a and miR-200a.
Copies of miR-200a increased strongly in primary keratinocytes of elderly human
donors, whereas miR-33a was downregulated (Tinaburri et al. 2018 ). Another study
reported miR-200c as a key driver that restricts cell migration during wound healing
in keratinocytes and possibly contributes to age-linked changes in wound repair
(Aunin et al. 2017 ).
The age-associated differential regulation of miRNAs has also been found in
Langerhans cells, which are immature skin-residential dendritic cells (DCs) that
work in immune response against antigens (Gerasymchuk et al. 2020 ). Multiple
miRNAs have been linked with the development of Langerhans cells (miR-142 and
miR-22 through the interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8)), maturation, differentia-
tion (miR-34a, miR-99b, miR-21, miR-551, and miR-223), and immunological
function (miR-21, miR-142-3p, miR-10, miR-155, and miR-146a) (Zhou and Wu
2017 ). Ageing Langerhans cells are associated with increased expression of
miR-709, miR-449, and miR-9 and decreased expression of miR-200c and
miR-10a (Xu et al. 2012 ). Increased levels of miR-449 and miR-9 regulated ageing
of Langerhans cells by downregulating the TGF-signaling pathway (Xu et al. 2012 ).
The miR-17-92 cluster, which encodes six miRNAs, i.e., miR-17, miR-18a,
miR-19a, miR-19b-1, miR-20a, and miR-92a-1 is expressed in Langerhans cells
(Kuo et al. 2019 ). However, due to functional redundancy, the miR-17-92 cluster


9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 213

plays an unclear role in antigen presentation, survival, maturation, and migration
capability in Langerhans cells (Zhou et al. 2014 ; Zhang et al.2016b).
Another study found that the level of miR-29a and miR-30 rises duringfibroblast
senescence, an example of replicative senescence (Martinez et al. 2011 ). MiR-29a
and miR-30 trigger senescence by directly suppressing B-Myb, a transcription factor
that governs cellular senescence via regulating the expression of a number of genes
related to cell proliferation (Martinez et al. 2011 ). Moreover, microRNAs are also
targeted as biomarkers of ageing in human dermal senescentfibroblasts. The
15 identified miRNAs, include, let-7d-5p, let-7e-5p, 34a-5p, miR-23a-3p,
miR-122-5p, miR-125a-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-125a-3p, miR-181a-5p, miR-222-
3p, miR-221-3p, miR-503-5p, miR-574-5p, miR-574-3p, and miR-4454. MiR-221/
222 was found to be present in both categories of cellular senescence: replicative and
stress-induced (Markopoulos et al. 2017 ). Other research demonstrated that
miR-200c-3p was found to be threefold more abundant in older skinfibroblasts
(65–80 years) than in young ones (4–6 years). This increase in miR-200c expression
disrupts the sirtuin1 (SIRT1)/forkhead box O1 (FOXO1)/endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (eNOS) regulatory loop, which enhances ROS production and reduces
nitric oxide (NO), contributing to endothelial dysfunction (Carlomosti et al. 2017 ).
Furthermore, prolonged oxidative stress-induced senescence elevated miR-200c in
humanfibroblasts (Magenta et al. 2011 ). Senescence in dermalfibroblasts has been
also linked to the downregulation of miRNAs such as miR-106 and miR-17-92
cluster (Hackl et al. 2010 ). MiR-17-92 regulates the transcription of genes that
control cell cycle and tumor development, including BCL2L11 (BIM) (Cloonan
et al. 2008 ), p63 (Manni et al. 2009 ), and p21 (Inomata et al. 2009 ). It was believed
to counteract senescence by enhancing the proliferation process (Mancini et al.
2014 ).
Because of prolonged/repeated exposure to ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation,
human skin prematurely ages, a process known as photoageing. UV rays can
penetrate deeper into the skin, triggering a series of specific molecular reactions in
both dermis and epidermis (Yaar and Gilchrest 2007 ). Dermalfibroblasts are more
sensitive to UV radiation than epidermal keratinocytes in humans. UV-A radiation
specifically interferes with the expression of collagen genes in human dermal
fibroblasts by upregulating c-Jun expression (Quan et al. 2010 ). Studies have
identified downregulation of miR-155 with concomitant upregulation of c-Jun
upon exposure to UV-A irradiation (Song et al. 2012 ). The expression of
miR-146a is reduced by exposure to both UV-A and/or UV-B radiation in primary
culturedfibroblasts. However, its overexpression inhibits UV-A irradiation-induced
proliferation by upregulating the expression of photoageing-linked genes (p21WAF-
1 and p53) (Li et al. 2013 ). The 3’-UTR of the SMAD4 gene is specifically targeted
by miR-146a but whether this is the critical target and how Smad4 promotes
photoageing remains to be understood (Li et al. 2013 ). Microarray-based studies
discovered several miRNAs implicated in premature cellular senescence induced by
UV-B irradiation (Zhou et al. 2012 ). MiR-34c-5p, which targets the 3’-UTR of E2F3
gene, is upregulated in irradiated cells. E2F3 protein is required for proliferation,
development, and cell cycle progression, and it also provides protection to dermal

fibroblasts against UV-B-induced premature senescence by regulating the
senescence-linked genes p53 and p21WAF-1 (Zhou et al. 2013 ). MiR-101, which
targets the 3’-UTR of EZH2 gene is also upregulated in response to UV-B exposure
(Greussing et al. 2013 ). In UV-B-induced senescence of human dermalfibroblasts,
the functional interaction of miR-101 and EZH2 has been demonstrated. However,
upregulating miR-101 while simultaneously downregulating Ezh2 is insufficient to
inhibit the UV-B-induced senescence phenotype, implying system redundancy
(Greussing et al. 2013 ). Thefindings coming from studies on UV-induced senes-
cence in the in vitro system clearly suggest that miRNAs have a role in skin ageing
as well.
Thefindings reveal that the expression of ageing-related miRNAs influences the
function of several genes in different tissues and may accelerate or inhibit ageing.
However, little is known regarding the involvement of miRNA in organismal ageing
in terms of longevity and, presumably, age-related diseases.

###### miRNAs in Neuronal or Brain Ageing

Brain ageing is one of the most fundamental biological processes, which controls the
delicate physiological balance or homeostasis between health and disease. Alteration
in protein homeostasis or proteostasis has been observed in a number of age-linked
neurological ailments including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s as well as in normal
ageing. Studies from our group and several other labs have revealed dramatic
regulation of miRNA in developing neurons and brain (Eacker et al. 2011 ;L
et al.2011a; Inukai et al. 2012 ; Yin et al. 2015 ; Jauhari et al. 2017 , 2018a, b;
Chen et al.2019a). Our group has identified several miRNAs viz., miR-200, miR-34
families, miR-153, miR-21, miR-193-5p, miR-146a, miR-221/222, miR-199a-5,
and miR-29b and employing two different neuronal differentiation cellular models
(PC12 and SH-SY5Y) which govern many aspects of neural formation (Jauhari et al.
2017 , 2018a, b). The set of miRNAs that are identified by more than one lab to play
role in neural or brain ageing are miR-34 (Li et al.2011b; Zovoilis et al. 2011 ; Liu
et al.2012b; Kou et al. 2016 , 2017; Jauhari et al.2018a, b; Kennerdell et al. 2018 ;
Chen et al.2019b; Srinivasan et al. 2022 ), miR-29b (Baumgart et al. 2012 ;
Takahashi et al. 2012 ; Fenn et al. 2013 ; Nolan et al. 2014 ; Takeda and Tanabe
2016 ; Ripa et al. 2017 ; Napoli et al. 2020 ), and miR-181 (Khanna et al. 2011 ; Rao
et al. 2013 ; Stein et al. 2022 ).
Recent research on hippocampal tissues from young and aged mice reported that
80 out of 269 miRNAs were differentially expressed between different age groups
(Mohammed et al. 2016 ). Another study found that out of the 70 miRNAs that were
upregulated during murine brain ageing, 27 miRNAs were predicted to have direct
binding sites for mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and F1Fo-ATPase,
both of which play an important role in oxidative phosphorylation and whose
expression declines with age, possibly explaining why respiration rates decrease
with ageing (Li et al.2011a).


9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 215

Several brain ageing studies have identified miR-34, which is highly conserved in
Drosophila melanogaster,C. elegans, mice, and humans. miR-34 is essential in
order to maintain healthy brain tissue and function in Drosophila, and its levels in the
brain increase with age (Liu et al.2012b). Mir-34 mutants exhibit shorter lifespans,
early-onset neuronal death, and a higher rate of increase in age-related transcripts in
brain, suggesting that miR-34 facilitates brain ageing (Liu et al.2012b). Our group
has reported that differentiated and aged neuronal cells were the greatest source of
miR-34 following expression profiling studies of miR-34 family in distinct devel-
oping cells, neuronal, and non-neuronal (Jauhari et al.2018a, b). According to our
research, the brain-enriched miR-34 family upregulates with maturation of neurons
and brain ageing, and the collaborative regulation of miR-34a and P53 aids in the
differentiation of neurons through arresting cells in the G1 phase of cell cycle
(Jauhari et al.2018a, b).
miR-34 has been reported to suppress polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)
via regulating the expression of chaperones and promoting healthy brain ageing in
Drosophila (Kennerdell et al. 2018 ). Furthermore, miR-34 also influences
proteostasis in the ageingfly brain by regulating components of the Polycomb
Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) complex and Lst8, a subunit of Tor Complex
1 (TORC1) (Srinivasan et al. 2022 ). The activation of the SIRT1/mTOR signaling
pathway, which is regulated by miR-34a, has been reported to protect against D-gal-
induced cognitive impairment (Chen et al.2019b). Another study found that
inhibiting autophagy in brain tissues via ageing-associated activation of astrocytes
and triggering the mTOR signaling pathway, as well as upregulating miR-34a,
caused cognitive abnormalities in D-gal-induced ageing rats (Kou et al. 2016 ). The
same group has further demonstrated that swimming can slow down brain ageing by
reducing the damage of miR-34a-mediated autophagy and aberrant mitochondrial
dynamics (Kou et al. 2017 ). A member of the miR-34 family, miR-34c, has been
found to increase in the mouse hippocampus in both ageing and AD models, as well
as in people with AD (Zovoilis et al. 2011 ). Other research reported an age-related
upregulation in miR-34a expression in mouse brain and blood, as well as repression
of its target Sirt1 in both tissues. The relationship between the expression of miR-34a
and SIRT1 in the blood could be investigated to develop valuable biomarkers for the
noninvasive detection of brain ageing (Li et al.2011b). Also, research revealed an
age-dependent decrease in the expression level of miRNAs such as mmu-miR-34a,
mmu-miR-181a-1*, and mmu-miR-30e along with an increase in Bcl-2 expression
and a decrease in pro-apoptotic genes like Bax and cleaved caspases (Khanna et al.
2011 ).
MicroRNA-29 family members (miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c) are increased
with age in the central nervous system (CNS) of various vertebrate species, including
fish (Baumgart et al. 2012 ), mice (Ugalde et al. 2011 ; Takahashi et al. 2012 ; Nolan
et al. 2014 ), monkeys (Fenn et al. 2013 ), and humans (Somel et al. 2010 ; Fenn et al.
2013 ). Age-related overexpression of the miR-29 family in the mouse brain leads to
microglia dysregulation and enhanced neuroinflammation, both of which are hall-
marks of brain ageing. MiR-29a and miR-29b, two members of miR-29 family, were
found to be overexpressed in the brains of aged BALB/c mice in comparison to


216 S. Yadav et al.

young animals, and these elevated levels were negatively correlated with the expres-
sion of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and fractalkine ligand (CX3CL1), both
of which are negative regulators of microglial activation (Fenn et al. 2013 ). More-
over, miR-29 appeared to be upregulated in klotho-deficient mice (Takahashi et al.
2012 ), a model of premature ageing, and the progeroid mouse model Zmpste24-/-
(Ugalde et al. 2011 ). The miR-29 expression was enhanced during ageing in the
brain of the short-lived turquoise killifish, and it governs iron homeostasis by
targeting iron-responsive element-binding protein 2 (Ireb2), which encodes an
RNA-binding protein that helps promote intracellular iron trafficking in the brain.
This age-dependent rise in the level of miR-29 is an adaptive regulatory mechanism
that prevents the development of several ageing-associated phenotypes. Its anti-
ageing effect is largely due to its ability to govern intracellular iron homeostasis and
lower excessive exposure to iron in nerve cells (Ripa et al. 2017 ). miR-29a has been
discovered as a regulator of the plasticity brakes in visual cortex, which promotes
age-dependent stabilization of visual cortical connections (Napoli et al. 2020 ).
Another research reported that the knockdown of miR-29 in brain had a gender-
specific effect on both longevity and reproduction in mice (Takeda and Tanabe
2016 ).
Genome-wide screening of miRNAs discovered miR-144 as the only miRNA that
was consistently upregulated in the cortex regions and cerebellum of ageing humans
and Chimpanzees. Ataxin-1, a gene responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type
1 (SCA1) and other polyglutamine diseases was identified to be the direct target of
miR-144 (Persengiev et al. 2012 ). Numerous miRNAs are elevated in the hippo-
campus region of both long-living Ames dwarf mice and growth hormone receptor
(GHR) gene-disrupted strains (Liang et al. 2011 ). MicroRNAs such as miR-669b,
miR-470, and miR-681 were identified as the top three upregulated microRNAs,
which functionally target IGF1R and AKT, two major upstream genes governing the
phosphorylation of FoxO3a, hence dampening the IGF1 signaling pathway (Liang
et al. 2011 ). The expression of miR-186 in the cortical neurons of the mouse brain
decreased with age, whereas its overexpression in neuronal cells considerably
reduced the level of Aβby repressing BACE1 expression (Kim et al. 2016 ). In the
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of SAMP8 mice, miR-449a expression has been
observed to decrease with age, and overexpression of miR-449a enhances neuronal
process extension through targeting sodium channel voltage-gated beta 2 (SCN2B)
in the brain (Tan et al.2020b). The switching of let-7-to-miR-125 during the pupal-
to-adult transition ensures chinmo suppression in adults, preserving neuronal integ-
rity and extending life span via regulating ageing-associated processes (Chawla et al.
2016 ). Another miRNA, miR-1000, is highly expressed in the central nervous
system (CNS) but diminishes with age and has a neuroprotective effect in old
Drosophila as well. Mir-1000 mutants have significantly shorter lifespans, disorga-
nized locomotion, and neurodegeneration begins considerably earlier than in wild-
type counterparts. Although miR-1000 seems to be unique to Drosophila, its seed
sequence is very similar to mammalian miR-137, the depletion of which leads to
increased neuronal death, implying that it might play a similar function in regulating
neurodegeneration (Verma et al. 2015 ).


9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 217

The area of miRNA and ncRNA research has been developed rapidly. The
discovery of the highest number of brain-specific miRNAs in the past few years
has provided a new degree of understanding of neurological complications related to
ageing. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to completely comprehend the
mechanisms of action of miRNAs in normal brain ageing and neurodegenerative
ailments, so that miRNA expression could be explored as a novel point of entry for
therapeutic interventions. The challenge now is to annotate the biological functions
of the ever-increasing number of miRNAs, each of which has a long list of potential
targets (Table9.2).
The complexity of ageing triggers a vast number of major disorders including
cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases (North and Sinclair 2012 ).
Regardless of much evidence behind ageing-induced ailments, the scientific litera-
ture still has huge research gaps about the molecular pathways that link ageing
process with diseases. Several factors including senescence, telomere dysfunction,
alterations in protein processing and gene expression occur in both ageing and
diseases. Regulation of miRNAs emerged as an interplay between ageing and
diseases. Studies are being pursued for the pathomechanism behind age-related
diseases which are summarized in this chapter.

###### MiRNAs and Age-Related Cardiac Diseases

The predominance of cardiac diseases has become the leading cause of mortality
throughout the globe. Cardiac ageing is accompanied by impairments in both
cardiomyocytes and non-cardiomyocytes, and further results in deterioration of the
cardiac system. With an increasing number of heart-related diseases, there is an
urgent need to identify and generate therapy to lead to treatment. Advancement in
medicine opens new avenues for molecular biology which introduced next-
generation throughput sequencing, a renowned technique for identifying miRNAs
as potential markers for disease. Starting with the process of heart development,
regeneration to severe heart failure, and other dysfunctions, miRNAs have emerged
as an essential and vital player.
It is widely known that ageing reduces the cardio-protective mechanism which
ultimately increases the probability of heart failure. More than 90% of deaths, which
happened due to heart failure occurs in people aged 70 years or more (Strait and
Lakatta 2012 ). The cause of heart failure is cardiomyocyte dysfunction, whose
treatment does not resolve with normal routine treatment procedures. At the cellular
level, miR-133 is highly enriched in cardiomyocytes, and is known to express at
lower levels in animal models with hypertrophy and patients suffering from hyper-
trophic cardiomyopathy (Sacks et al. 2018 ; Colpaert and Calore 2019 ). Studies
summarizing the role of miRNAs in normal heart and cardiovascular diseases are
increasing at a rapid rate (Nishiguchi et al. 2015 ; Romaine et al. 2015 ; Ultimo et al.
2018 ). Van Rooij and colleaguesfirst reported the abnormal expression of miRNAs
in the heart due to hypertrophy (Van Rooij et al. 2006 ; Van Rooij and Olson 2007 ).

9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 223

Studies have also identified numerous up- and downregulated miRNAs in a mouse
model of cardiac hypertrophy (Martinelli et al. 2014 ). Interestingly, a few of them
were also identified in end-stage failing human hearts, indicating the relevance of
study to human pathology. Several studies also reported the dysregulation of
miRNA expression in hypertrophic hearts. A report using cellular and animal models
identified overexpression of miR-133 with well-preserved cardiac functions while
suppressing shows hypertrophy (Abdellatif 2010 ). The role of miR-133 is also
shown to regulate the cardiac action potential (Kuzmin et al. 2021 ). Along with
miR-133, miR-1 was also downregulated in animal models with hypertrophic heart
along with patients suffering from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, while upregulation
of miR-133 or miR-1 rescues cardiac hypertrophy (Gladka et al. 2012 ). Revealing
miR-133 and miR-1 as key regulators of cardiac hypertrophy, the possibility of using
them as therapeutic applications for heart disease is quite strong (Care et al. 2007 ). It
is known that insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling is a crucial contributor to cardiac
hypertrophy and arrhythmias. Remarkably, miR-1 targets insulin-like growth factor-
1, which further suppresses pre-miR-1 transcript process (Elia et al. 2009 ). Another
miRNA, miR-208, was found to be differently expressed in cardiomyocytes (Callis
et al. 2009 ; Huang et al. 2021 ) but later, deep sequencing data from human hearts
showed lower expression of miR-208 expression compared to other cardiac
miRNAs, such as miR-1 and miR-133.

###### MiRNAs and Age-Related Neurodegenerative Diseases

With the rise in the number of elderly people, the burden of neurodegenerative
disorders (NDs) is increasing. As per the WHO, neurological disorders will overtake
cardiovascular diseases as the second leading cause of mortality by 2040. It is
predicted that the occurrence of dementia cases will rise by 300% in developing
countries and up to 100% in developed countries over the coming years (Ferri et al.
2005). For these NDs, a few drugs have been developed which only manage the
disease progression, but are unable to prevent or completely cure them. A major
reason behind this unusual situation for incompetent drugs is different mechanisms
for each ND. Selected degeneration of neurons in the brain causes several common
NDs. Neurodegeneration is a broad term, which mostly affects the structure and
function of neurons in brain. The family of NDs includes many members
(Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis),
whose nature depends on the affected region and neuron types, which are quite
specific to each disease. Several pathomechanisms are behind these NDs including
mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress,
neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, calcium deregulation, and many more are being
studied. But the detailed pathomechanism behind these NDs is still unclear.
MiRNAs are highly investigated and may play a crucial role in neuronal develop-
ment and neuronal degeneration. These miRNA sequences have been found to be
deregulated in the peripheral blood, cerebrospinalfluid, and brain regions in patients


224 S. Yadav et al.

suffering from any one ND. To better validate the situation, nowadays in vitro and
in vivo models of neurodegeneration are widely used to identify the regulation of
miRNAs. Thorough research is needed to develop these miRNAs as biomarkers for
these NDs.

###### Alzheimer’s Disease

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is ranked thefirst ND characterized by neuronal loss and
inflammation, and represents the most frequent form of dementia found in elderly
people, affecting learning, language, memory, and behavior (Bookheimer et al.
2000 ). Studies have established the role of mutations in genes like amyloid precursor
protein (APP) and Presenilin in the early onset of AD in a few cases. The slow and
continuous accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates in the form of plaques and
tangles in brain over the period of 10–20 years results in cognitive and behavioral
symptoms, which is a remarkable feature of AD (Hardy and Selkoe 2002 ). Amyloid-
β(Aβ) is generated through the sequential cleavage performed by two proteolytic
enzymes: amyloid precursor protein (APP) byβ-APP-cleaving enzyme 1(BACE1)
and theγ-secretase complex (Tamagno et al.2008). The exact pathologic processes
underlying the onset and progression of AD are presently unclear. Various clinical
and research studies have shown that abnormal regulation of miRNA-dependent
expression of genes is closely related to molecular processes that are responsible for
Aβproduction, neuroinflammatory tangles (NFT) formation, and neuronal cell
death. The distinguished and prominent function of miRNAs in the onset and
progression of AD has been confirmed in various studies (Delay et al. 2012 ;
Femminella et al. 2015 ; Wang et al.2019b). Lukiw and colleaguesfirstly provided
evidence for the involvement of miRNAs in AD pathology (Lukiw and Pogue 2007 ).
Regulation of individual miR-132 or the miR-132/212 cluster has also been dem-
onstrated in AD pathogenesis in many studies. Deficiency of miR-132/212 has been
investigated in mice, which impairs the normal Tau mechanisms and leads to its
aggregation (Smith et al. 2015 ). In addition, the study also defined the mechanism
behind the association of cluster miR-132/212 and AD pathology (Pichler et al.
2017 ). They revealed that loss of miR-132/212 increases the level of nitric oxide,
followed by disruption of S-nitrosylation (SNO) balance, which induces tau pathol-
ogy and may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and other tauopathies (Pichler
et al. 2017 ). Recently, studies were carried out on human cortical brain tissues,
which showed the consistent downregulation of the miR-132/212 cluster and impli-
cated its crucial role in AD pathology (El Fatimy et al. 2018 ).
Hébert and colleagues reported the crucial role of miR-29 in the development of
AD (Hébert et al. 2008 ). Using neuronal cellular models, they observed a negative
correlation between miR-29 expression and levels of BACE1 proteins, which
resulted in abnormal production of Aβ. Studies have also tried to develop miR-29
family members as biomarkers of PD and AD (Müller et al. 2016 ). Members of
miR-29 family are reported to be regulated in the brains of aged humans (Ugalde
et al. 2011 ; Ripa et al. 2017 ). Studies provide insight into AD pathological


9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 225

mechanisms and revealed the miR-34 family as a therapeutic target (Sarkar et al.
2016 ). Using a transgenic AD model and AD patients, inhibition of miR-34c
upregulated VAMP2 expression, which rescued synaptic failure and also alleviated
learning and memory impairments induced due to Aβtoxicity (Hu et al. 2015 ). Kim
and colleagues identified the crucial role of miR-186 in AD pathogenesis. They
reported that inhibition of miR-186 suppresses the expression of BACE1 in aged
brain, which is a prominent risk in AD development (Kim et al. 2016 ). In SH-SY5Y
cells, upregulation of a known inflammatory regulator miRNA (miR-146a) was
reported which inhibits LRP2 expression followed by increasing cellular apoptosis
and suggested its major role in regulating AKL/LRP2 pathway in AD (Zhang et al.
2016a). A recent study identified miR-485-3p overexpression in the tissues of brain,
cerebrospinalfluid, as well as in plasma of patients with AD. Inhibition of miR-485-
3P has been shown to reduce Aβplaque buildup, tau pathology propagation,
neuronal inflammation, and cognitive impairment, which are the characteristic
features of AD (Koh et al. 2021 ). Recent research has demonstrated that miR-212-
3p, which is one of the major studied miRNAs in neurodegeneration has a protective
role in animal and cellular models of AD (Nong et al. 2022 ). NF-κB (nuclear factor
kappa B) signaling has been extensively studied in AD pathogenesis. The latest
study has also shown the involvement of IKKβ-mediated Aβaggregation and neuron
regeneration in APP/PS1 mice and identified the potential role of miR-155-5p as a
probable candidate in AD treatment (Wang et al. 2022 ). Synaptic loss associated
with cognition impairment in AD identified miRNA-455-5p/CPEB1 pathway
mouse-based AD model, which suggests miR-455 as a promising therapeutic target
for AD (Xiao et al. 2021 ). Using AD patients and mice, the miR-124/PTPN1
pathway was identified as a critical regulator of synaptic dysfunction as well as
cognitive decline in AD, and can be considered as a potential novel therapeutic target
for AD (Wang et al. 2018 ).

###### Parkinson’s Disease

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive NDD affecting a large number of individ-
uals around the world and is characterized by rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, and
shaking followed by loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantial nigra pars
compacta. Two important genes which are known to associate with PD are SNCA
and LRRK2. SNCA (Alpha-synuclein) is localized in the presynaptic terminals in
association with the plasma membrane and its expression is broadly present in the
adult brain, specifically the hippocampus, neocortex, and substantia nigra (Bekris
and Mata 2010 ). LRRK2 belongs to the leucine-rich repeat kinase family and is
found primarily in the cytoplasm, but also associated with the mitochondrial outer
membrane. It is largely expressed in the brain, with hippocampus and striatum
having the highest levels of expression (Galter et al. 2006 ; Melrose et al. 2006 ).
Despite the fact that PD is a multigenic and fatal disorder, numerous efforts have
been undertaken in the direction of therapeutic approach using miRNAs, and the
findings are encouraging, even if clinical implementation still appears to be a long


226 S. Yadav et al.

way off. Though PD is a multigenic and fatal disease, various efforts have been made
in the direction of miRNA-based therapeutics, with promising results, albeit still far
from clinical implementation. Neuroinflammation in case of neurodegenerative
diseases acts as a marker for diagnosing the effects of neuronal damage. Recent
research identified the crucial role and regulation of miR-155 in mediating the
inflammatory response in PD (Thome et al. 2016 ). Studies have also demonstrated
ectopic expression of miR-7, reduced level of SNCA significantly in cultured
neuronal cells, and knocking down of miR-7 greatly enhanced SNCA expression
(Doxakis 2010 ). Another miRNA, miR-153 has been predicted to target and bind to
the 3’UTR of SNCA in between 462 and 468 bases, which is a conserved sequence
among all the vertebrate species. MiR-153 is highly abundant in brain, and is
reported to regulate the expression of SNCA negatively (Kim et al. 2013 ). Signif-
icant studies by Chaudhuri et al. ( 2016 ) reported the contribution of miR-7 in
mitochondrial dysfunction which is one of the contributors to PD (Chaudhuri et al.
2016 ). They identified VDAC1 as a target of miR-7, and suggested it to be a novel
biomarker that protects neuronal cells undergoing mitochondrial abnormality
(Chaudhuri et al. 2016 ). The significant role of miRNAs has also been demonstrated
by profiling the expression pattern in PD patients. By profiling the expression of
miRNAs in PD patients, it has been identified that level of miR-133b has signifi-
cantly deregulated (Kim et al. 2007 ). Moreover, it has also been shown that a
feedback loop mechanism takes place between Pitx3 and miR-133b, which repre-
sents a link between miRNAs and neurodegenerative disorders (Kim et al. 2007 ).
Nevertheless,miR-133b has been reported as a negative regulator of differentiation
of dopaminergic neurons, as its ectopic overexpression in primary rat embryonic
midbrain cultures resulted in a decreased number of dopaminergic neurons, whereas
its knockdown has shown the opposite effect. Furthermore, another miRNA expres-
sion profiling study in PD brains has shown a significant downregulation in the
expression of miR-34b and miR-34c in brain regions including frontal cortex,
amygdala, cerebellum, and substantia nigra (Miñones-Moyano et al. 2011 ). Addi-
tionally, in vitro studies have also suggested the role of miR-34b and miR-34c in the
pathogenesis of PD. Decreased expression of miR-34b or miR-34c was observed in
differentiated SH-SY5Y cells resulting in cell viability reduction as well as cellular
mitochondrial function abnormality (Miñones-Moyano et al. 2011 ). Later, studies
have also revealed that downregulation of miR-34b and miR-34c increases
α-synuclein expression in PD (Kabaria et al. 2015 ). Dopaminergic neuron degener-
ation along with microglia activation underlies pathomechanisms of PD. A recent
study identified miR-132-3p in cellular, animal, and brain tissues of PD patients,
which targets GLRX and mediates microglia activation (Gong et al. 2022 ).
Renowned brain-specific miRNA, miR-29 plays a role in both ageing and PD
pathogenesis (Bai et al. 2021 ). Cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients identified
miR-409-3p regulates ATXN3 which rescues the dopaminergic neurons from cell
death (Tan et al. 2021 ). Recent studies from our lab have discovered a direct role of
NF-kβ-mediated upregulation of miR-146a in controlling mitophagy via Parkin gene
suppression in an animal model of PD (Jauhari et al. 2020 ). Indeed, different models
identified a class of miRNAs that are crucial regulators of PD. Further studies are
required to target these miRNAs as therapeutic models.


9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 227

###### Huntington’s Disease

Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurological disease caused by an increase in CAG
repeats beyond 36 at exon 1 of the huntingtin gene (HTT). The symptoms behind
HD include mental disorders, psychopathological dysfunctions as well as motor and
cognitive abnormalities. Long projections of neurons and synapses in the cortex and
striatum region of the brain are also lost in this condition. One of the most prevalent
pathological problems in HD has been transcription dysregulation caused by abnor-
malities in the actions of transcription factors. Several pathways are targeted and
interacted by miRNAs during the development of HD and its progression. Numerous
studies have been cited to date about the role and regulation of miRNAs in
HD. Studies by Fu MH et al. ( 2015 ) revealed the therapeutic potential of
miR-196a in HD using a bioinformatics approach (Fu et al. 2015 ), which was
previously reported as a terminator of pathological phenotypes of HD in different
models (Cheng et al. 2013 ). Another miRNA, miR-214, has been reported in an HD
cell model which targets mitofusin2 (MFN2), where its upregulation affected mito-
chondrial morphology and disrupted the cell cycle. One of the brain-specific
miRNAs, miR-124 has been investigated in lowering the progression of HD by
inducing neurogenesis in the striatum of brain (Liu et al. 2015 ). Compiled studies of
next-generation sequencing profiling carried out on human HD and control brain
tissues identified various miRNAs linked to neurite outgrowth, neuronal differenti-
ation, survival, and cell death (Müller 2014 ). In this study, miR-10b-5p and
miR-30a-5p were identified to target BDNF that is known to associate with neuronal
functions (Müller 2014 ). Furthermore, regulation of miR-10b-5p expression in HD
pathogenicity was reported in context with age as well as the onset and extent of
striatal association (Hoss et al. 2015 ). This miR-10b-5p can be considered a bio-
marker for the detection and progression of HD. MiR-34b has also been reported as a
putative plasma-based biomarker for HD as miR-34b was significantly elevated in
mutated huntingtin (mHTT) cultured neurons (Gaughwin et al. 2011 ). Bioinformatic
analysis identified hsa-miR-10b-5p and hsa-miR-196a-5p which were significantly
upregulated in HD, targeting BDNF or homeobox genes which are critical regulators
in the pathogenesis of HD (Wang and Dong 2020 ). Specific microRNAs whose
alterations reduced the phenotypic features induced by mutant HTT and suggested
possible therapeutic targets for HD have been explored by employing animal models
of Huntington’s disease and HD patients (Dong and Cong 2021 ).

###### Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most prevalent and severe type of NDD,
which leads to motor neuron degeneration and causes death within 3–5 years of
diagnosis. Mutations in over 20 genes linked to familial forms of ALS have revealed
newer insights into the causes of motor neuron death. Loss of motor neurons, muscle


228 S. Yadav et al.

atrophy, and deterioration of target muscles are all symptoms of ALS, which results
in paralysis. ALS occurs in two forms, either familial ALS (FALS) (which accounts
for 10% of cases) or sporadic ALS (SALS) (which accounts for 90% of cases).
Indeed, it affects a large number of people but due to the little understanding of
mechanisms, there is presently no established cure. Regulation of miRNAs during
the development of ALS is well accepted and recent studies provide inclusive
support for the involvement of miRNAs in disease development. A report by
Williams et al. ( 2009 ) identified the role of miR-206 in the development of ALS
in a mouse model. They reported that mice, which were genetically deficient for
miR-206 formed normal neuromuscular synapses throughout development, while
miR-206 deficiency in the ALS mouse model accelerates the progression of disease
(Williams et al. 2009 ). In mice, miRNA-206 slows the course of ALS and encour-
ages the regeneration of neuromuscular synapses (Williams et al. 2009 ). Studies by
Koval et al. ( 2013 ) discovered the regulation of miRNAs in the rodent model of ALS
and reported significant alteration in 12 miRNAs. Out of the 12 identified miRNAs
(miR-17, miR-20a, miR-19b, miR-24-2, miR-142-3p, miR-106, miR-142-5p,
miR-146a, miR-146b, miR-155, miR-223, and miR-338-3p) six miRNAs were
tested and confirmed in ALS tissues of humans. Specifically, miR-155 was
upregulated twofold in humans as well asfivefolds in mice spinal cord samples.
Moreover, injection of anti-miR-155 increased survival by 10 days and duration of
disease by 15 days in SOD1G93A mice (Koval et al. 2013 ; de Andrade et al. 2016.
Recent studies by De Andrade et al. ( 2016 ) identified 11 miRNAs (miR-424,
miR-503, miR-886-3p, miR-542-5p, miR-34a, miR-886-5p, miR-146b-5p,
miR-504, miR-21, miR-214, and miR-183) differentially expressed in the skeletal
muscle of ALS patients, and only two miRNAs (miR-424 and miR-206) were
significantly overexpressed in the plasma of ALS patients. The baseline expression
of miR-424 and miR-206 corresponds with the progression of clinical symptoms
over time, suggesting the potential of these two miRNAs to be used as prognostic
markers for ALS. Freischmidt and colleagues identified miR-1234-3p and miR-1825
in sera of sporadic ALS patients and reported it as a signature role in ALS develop-
ment (Freischmidt et al. 2015 ). Research is going on to identify novel miRNAs
which will behave like prognostic as well as diagnostic biomarkers for these NDs.

###### Stem Cell Development and miRNAs

In the current era, the lifespan of humans is substantially longer in comparison to
other primates with maximum age reaching up to 115 years (Finch 2010 ). Extended
longevity has also offered several challenges for our body and has increased
vulnerability and susceptibility to age-associated diseases like cancer and neurode-
generative diseases. Stem cells are a class of undifferentiated and pluripotent cells,
which have multilineage differentiation capability. Ideally, stem cells are categorized
into embryonic stem cells (ESCs), adult stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs). Adult stem cells are classified as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),


9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 229

cardiac stem cells (CSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), endothelial stem cells,
neural stem cells (NSCs), and so on, depending on the tissue from which they
originated. ESCs are pluripotent stem cells generated from the inner cell mass of a
blastocyst in epiblast tissue, whereas iPSCs are derived by reprogramming of
somatic cells (Hochedlinger and Plath 2009 ; Patel and Yang 2010 ; Nichols and
Smith 2012 ). Stem cells have much potential in clinical therapy because of their
pluripotency and ability to self-renew. Several studies illustrated the use of osteo-
blasts, cardiac cells, and neural cells differentiated from stem cells in repair of
damaged organs through transplantation (Pittenger and Martin 2004 ; Oryan et al.
2017 ). The promise of a stem cell is its enormous potential to self-renew and
generate several differentiated cells which are governed by dynamic interaction
between extrinsic signaling, transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and epigenetic reg-
ulations. Studies carried out in the last decade strongly suggest the role of miRNA-
mediated translation inhibition in the differentiation and self-renewal of stem cells
(Park et al. 2007 ; Guo et al. 2011 ). Several studies have demonstrated the involve-
ment of miRNAs in the proliferation and differentiation of germline stem cells,
embryonic stem cells, and various somatic tissue stem cells (Zhao et al. 2010 ;
Shenoy and Blelloch 2014 ). Each kind of stem cell possesses a distinct pattern of
miRNA profiles. It is hypothesized that miRNAs will be able to contribute to stem
cell therapy in clinics in the near future for regenerative medicine therapy.

###### Stem Cell Pluripotency and Role of miRNAs

MiRNAs contribute significantly to physiological processes as well as to the path-
ogenesis of several diseases. Studies have shown that miRNAs have great potential
as therapeutic tools for many disorders, including myocardial injury, neurodegener-
ative, and muscle ailments (Junn and Mouradian 2012 ; Harada et al. 2014 ; Alexan-
der and Kunkel 2015 ). Studies by Houbaviy et al. ( 2003 ) havefirst identified the
expression of miRNAs in undifferentiated and differentiated embryonic stem cells in
mice and proposed that miRNAs may play a role in the maintenance of the
pluripotency and early mammalian cell development (Houbaviy et al. 2003 ). The
involvement of miRNAs has been implicated in the regulation of stemness via
targeting the 3′-UTR of pluripotency factors or also known as Yamanaka factor.
The direct involvement of miR-145 in the regulation of OCT4 (also known as
Pou5f1), KLF4, and SOX2 which control pluripotency of human ESCs, has been
demonstrated in numerous studies (Xu et al. 2009 ; Li et al. 2017 , 2018a, b). Studies
from our lab have demonstrated that upregulation of miR-145 during neuronal
differentiation or maturation is regulated by another miRNA (miR-29b) in a
P53-dependent manner in SH-SY5Y, a human neuroblastoma (Jauhari et al. 2017 ,
2018a, b).Furthermore, miR-470, miR-296, and miR-134 mediate mouse ESC
differentiation via targeting coding regions of transcription factors such as Oct4,
Nanog, and Sox2 (Tay et al.2008a). MiR-145 inhibits stem cell self-renewal and
induces differentiation by directly repressing SOX2, OCT4, and KLF4 (Xu et al.
2009 ). OCT4, in turn, suppresses miR-145 expression in a regulatory feedback loop


230 S. Yadav et al.

(Xu et al. 2009 ). In mouse ES cells, miR-296, miR-134, and miR-470 target the
coding region sequences of the Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 genes (Tay et al.2008b).
Bmi-1, a Polycomb family member, governs stem cell self-renewal by an epigenetic
process. Neural stem cell populations and breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) are both
triggered by Bmi-1 (Liu et al. 2006 ; Godlewski et al. 2010 ). MiR-128 inhibits
carcinogenesis and suppresses CSC self-renewal via targeting Bmi-1. Upregulation
of Bmi-1 is linked with miR-128 downregulation in glioblastoma cells (Godlewski
et al. 2010 ). In addition to miR-128, miR200, miR-183, and miR-203 regulate stem
cells via targeting Bmi-1 (Shimono et al. 2009 ).

###### miRNAs and Cardiovascular Differentiation

It is well studied that miRNAs mediate cardiovascular differentiation and generate
vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs), cardiomyocytes, as well as endothelial cells
(ECs). The role of miR-499 has been established in the differentiation of human
cardiomyocyte progenitor cells via targeting Sox6 (Sluijter et al. 2010 ). Moreover,
miRNAs have been studied in regulating cardiovascular differentiation of iPSCs
and ESCs. Several miRNAs like miR-6086, and miR-6087 have been identified
to suppress endothelial markers and play a role in endothelial biogenesis (Yoo
et al. 2012 ). In mouse iPSCs, miR-199b is being studied as a regulator of iPSc-
derived vascular cell differentiation by modulating crucial angiogenic signaling
pathways (Chen et al. 2015 ). It is established that miRNA-regulated cardiovascular
differentiation of stem cells has remarkable therapeutic potential in regenerative
medicine.

###### Neuronal Differentiation and miRNAs

Unlike most cells, neurons pull out from a proliferation cycle and differentiate into
mature structures with neurites, which establish connections with several other
neurites for communications. Several studies have been carried out on global
miRNA profiling and identified dramatic regulation in the expression of various
miRNAs in differentiated neurons in comparison to naïve cells (Jauhari et al. 2017 ,
2018a, b, 2020). The role of miR-124 was identifiedfirst in promoting neuronal
differentiation of the subventricular zone (SVZ) in adult mammalian brain (Cheng
et al. 2009 ; Åkerblom et al. 2012 ). Studies from our lab have shown a significant
increase in the expression level of three miRNA families (miR-34, miR-200, and
miR-221/222) using nerve growth factor differentiated PC12 cells as a model of
neuronal differentiation (Pandey et al. 2015 ). The expressions of miR-7, miR-9, and
miR-214 play a key role in neural lineage determination (Liu et al.2012a). MiR-9, a
brain-enriched miRNA, targets the nuclear receptor TLX, thus stimulating NSC
differentiation (Zhao et al. 2009 ). Enough evidence has proven that miR-29a work


9 Ageing at Molecular Level: Role of MicroRNAs 231

as an essential element in regulating differentiation, cell proliferation, as well as
survival (Kole et al. 2011 ;Roshanetal.2014; Swahari et al. 2021 ). A recent report
identified the role of miR-29a in NPC differentiation and provided hope for the
treatment of CNS damage (Gao et al.2020). The NR2F2 gene (nuclear receptor
subfamily 2, group F, member 2) is known to regulate neural differentiation in
human ESCs. It has been shown that Oct4 and miR-302 work as a regulatory loop
with NR2F2 during embryonic stem cell differentiation (Rosa and Brivanlou
2011).

###### Conclusion

MiRNAs offer intriguing possibilities as biological regulators of gene expression,
affecting the ability of transcripts to produce new proteins. They may have several
targets and the ability to alter biological processes through various molecular
pathways. A compilation of studies spanning a wide range of species and endpoints
provides compelling evidence that altered miRNA function is linked with ageing and
age-associated diseases. Many miRNAs have shown differential expression with
ageing across several tissues and organs in mammals, and some were shown to
govern pathways related to age-linked diseases, such as sarcopenia, cognitive
impairment, bone loss, skin ageing, and heart dysfunction. Also, restoring Dicer
levels as well as diurnal rhythms of Dicer-controlled RNA and miRNA expression
levels may pave the way for new therapeutic opportunities for ageing-related
problems. The key role of miRNAs in stem cells has also been studied in a number
of biological pathways, such as differentiation, proliferation, and self-renewal. There
is no doubt that many more miRNAs that govern ageing will be discovered as new
functions for miRNAs are recognized on a regular basis. Despite this, many funda-
mental issues about the role of miRNAs in ageing remain unanswered. At cell,
tissue, and organism level, there seem to be differences between reports of overall
upregulation and downregulation of miRNAs, and a combination of both throughout
ageing. It will be highly critical to determine whether distinct miRNAs are triggered
or inhibited in certain conditions. Numerous miRNAs target genes that enhance
lifespan, while others target genes that shorten lifespan; hence, miRNAs as a group
of regulatory molecules do not appear to have a specific effect on ageing. Individual
miRNAs, on the other hand, help to speed up or slow down ageing under specific
situations. Hence, a much more focused investigation into the involvement of
miRNAs in ageing is clearly needed. The expression and function of miRNAs are
tissue-specific, which adds to the complexity of understanding their role in ageing,
especially in mammalian species. As a result, examining how miRNAs regulate
ageing in various tissues will contribute to uncovering possible targets for epigenetic

#### CircRNA and Ageing

Ebrahim Mahmoudi and Murray J. Cairns

Abstract Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are closed-loop RNA transcripts formed by a
noncanonical back splicing mechanism. circRNAs are expressed in various tissues
and cell types in a temporospatially regulated manner and have diverse molecular
functions including their ability to act as miRNA sponges, transcriptional and
splicing regulators, protein traps, and even templates for polypeptide synthesis.
Emerging evidence suggests that circRNAs are themselves dynamically regulated
throughout development in various organisms, with a substantial accumulation
during ageing. Their regulatory roles in cellular pathways associated with ageing
and senescence, as well as their implications in ageing-related diseases, such as
neurological disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease, suggest that circRNAs are
key molecular determinants of the ageing process. Their unique structure, expression
specificity, and biological functions highlight a potential capacity for use as novel
biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment outcomes in a variety of condi-
tions including pathological ageing. CircRNA may also have potential as target for
interventions that manipulate ageing and longevity. In this chapter, we discuss the
most recent advances in circRNA changes in ageing and ageing-associated disease.

###### Introduction

Ageing is a gradual and continuous process associated with progressive changes in
the biology, physiology, psychology, and behavior of an organism. These changes
lead to a functional and structural decline in the body, and therefore an increasing
vulnerability to disease or disability (MacNee et al. 2014 ; Partridge et al. 2018 ). At
the biological level, ageing is associated with the dynamic impact of accumulating
molecular and cellular damage caused by environmental exposure, intrinsic chal-
lenges, and impaired checks-and-balance systems (Rodríguez-Rodero et al. 2011 ).
Studies in a variety of species have identified a set of“hallmarks”that provide a
framework to better understand the physiology and pathology of the ageing process.
These include genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic modification, and
loss of proteostasis. These processes can lead to impairment in cellular growth and
communication, responses to cellular stress and the immune system, and changed
mitochondrial function (López-Otín et al. 2013 ).
Epigenetic changes are modifications that impact gene expression through vari-
ous mechanisms including DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and noncoding
RNA (ncRNA) (Stamatovic et al. 2019 ). Both small and long ncRNAs, such miRNA
and lncRNA, have been shown to be critical regulatory molecules that modify the
rate of gene transcription and modulate their translation and stability through
posttranscriptional mechanisms (Wei et al. 2017 ). An emerging class of lncRNA
are covalently closed circles known as circular RNA (circRNA) (Memczak et al.
2013 ). While these highly abundant molecules were long thought to be nonsignif-
icant by-products of mRNA splicing, the advent of high throughput RNA sequenc-
ing technology has enabled systematic identification of circRNA and the further
observation that these intriguing molecules have unique properties that can support
biological functions (Memczak et al. 2013 ; Rybak-Wolf et al. 2015 ). circRNA are
formed by back-spliced transcripts produced by joining the exon termini using
canonical spliceosome machinery. These transcript isoforms have been discovered
in many organisms, from simple species such as fungi to more complex species such
as plants and animals. circRNAs are conserved and display high levels of stability
(Wang et al. 2014 ). In humans, they are present across the whole body but show
enrichment in the brain (Rybak-Wolf et al. 2015 ). circRNA investigations have
suggested there are several important biological functions carried out by these
molecules. In this chapter, we describe the molecular biology of circRNA and
discuss their regulatory roles in the ageing process and ageing-related diseases.

###### Biogenesis of circRNA

circRNA molecules are synthesized from pre-mRNA through a covalent joining of
the 3′and 5′ends of exons, which is carried out by the canonical spliceosome. The
main back-splicing mechanism is through intron pairing, where complementary


10 CircRNA and Ageing 251

sequences within the introns are aligned to form loop structures that promotes
circularization. This is mediated by inverted repetitive sequences known as Alu
elements that are enriched within the intronsflanking circularized exons (Jeck et al.
2013 ). More studies have shown back-splicing is also driven by RNA-binding
proteins (RBPs) such as Quaking homolog, KH domain RNA binding protein
(QKI) (Conn et al. 2015 ) and Muscleblind-like protein (MBL) (Ashwal-Fluss et al.
2014 ), as well as Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) (Errichelli et al. 2017 ) that bind to the
specific motifs in introns leading to the formation of circular transcripts. In addition,
nuclear factor 90 (NF90) and nuclear factor 110 (NF110) were shown to promote the
formation of circRNA through stabilizing intronic RNA pairs (Li et al.2017b).
Back-splicing, however, is negatively regulated by antagonists such as Adenosine
Deaminase Acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) and ATP-dependent RNA helicase A
(DHX9) that have been shown to suppress circRNA formation (Rybak-Wolf et al.
2015 ). These genes specifically bind to the duplexed RNAs formed by the pairing
intron and destabilize the stem structure, resulting in suppression of back-splicing
events. circRNA can also be generated through lariat formation. Lariats, which are
typically small lasso-shaped RNA molecules, are formed during canonical splicing
when RBPs splice two exons skipping over the exons between them. This generates
two products: (1) a truncated linear product, and (2) a lariat which is then processed
into a circRNA (Ebbesen et al. 2016 ).

###### Diversity and Types of circRNA

According to the circRNA database CSCD, more than one million unique circRNA
species have been predicted in the human genome (Xia et al. 2018 ). CircRNA are
found throughout the genome, with the protein-coding genes producing the largest
proportion of circRNA species (Rybak-Wolf et al. 2015 ). The majority of circRNAs
have a length of a few hundred nucleotides which mainly contain coding DNA
sequence segments (Szabo and Salzman 2016 ). Analysis of circRNAs revealed a
high level of alternative splicing occurring within these transcripts (Gao et al. 2016 ;
Mahmoudi et al. 2021 ). CircRNA are categorized into three types; exonic
(ecircRNA), exon–intron (EIcircRNA), intronic (ciRNA), and intergenic. These
are unequally distributed in subcellular compartments, EIcircRNA and ciRNA are
enriched in the nucleus while ecircRNA are transported to the cytoplasm (Zhang
et al.2019b). circRNAs, unlike other RNAs, are significantly more stable due to
their covalently closed structure without 5’or 3’ends, that results in a high resistance
to exonuclease-mediated degradation (Jeck and Sharpless 2014 ). It has been shown
that many identified circRNA transcripts exist across multiple species and organs
(Barrett and Salzman 2016 ), indicating conservation of these molecules and also
suggesting important roles of circRNAs in a variety of organisms.

###### Expression Patterns of circRNA

RNA-seq with either rRNA-depleted total RNA, polyA(-) enriched RNA, or RNA-
ase R treated RNA has been the main method of systematic detection and quantifi-
cation of circRNA transcripts. circRNA account for an estimate of 0.2–1% of the
transcriptome (Guo et al. 2014 ; Salzman et al. 2013 ). They are generally expressed at
low levels, which is comparable with lincRNAs and of lower abundance than
protein-coding transcripts. However, the abundance of individual circRNA vary
from very low to very high, with hundreds of circRNAs found significantly more
highly expressed relative to their corresponding linear transcript, and even some loci
exclusively produced as circular isoforms (Ji et al. 2019 ).
CircRNAs are dynamically expressed in various cell types, tissues, and organs in
a temporospatial manner (Mahmoudi and Cairns 2019 ). Tissue specificity of
circRNAs was shown by Ji et al. to be considerably higher than for protein-coding
genes (64% of circRNAs versus 15% of coding genes were highly tissue-specific).
They further revealed that the observed pattern was regulated by RBPs that associate
with circRNA formation, such as QKI, ADAR, and DHX9. Studies in the mamma-
lian brain have shown that circRNA are more enriched in this organ compared to
others (Rybak-Wolf et al. 2015 ). In addition to the mature tissues, circRNA are
highly expressed in stem cells. Initially, it was found that eleven circRNAs were
specifically expressed in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), which were also
validated in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Cao et al. 2018 ). High-
throughput profiling of circRNA in bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) revealed
thousands of circRNAs were expressed in these cells, some of which were regulated
after differentiation (Zhang et al.2019a). Transcriptome analysis in mice showed
over 18,000 circRNAs were expressed in male/female germline stem cells (Li et al.
2017a). Moreover, circRNAs were highly expressed in mouse neuronal stem cells,
37 of these were regulated during the neuronal stem cell differentiation (Yang et al.
2018a).

###### Function of circRNA

circRNAs have now been established as regulatory molecules that exert their
functions at different molecular levels including transcriptional, post-transcriptional
and post-translational stages. This broad level of action along with their diversity in
function make circRNA a distinct group with a versatile role that is not typical in
other RNAs. In the subsections below, we review the current evidence for their
function.


10 CircRNA and Ageing 253

###### CircRNAs as Regulators of Transcription and Alternative

###### Splicing

The current evidence suggests that circRNA play acis-regulatory role on their parent
coding genes. A primary study by Li et al. revealed that EIciRNAs interact with
promoters through U1 snRNP and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), promoting gene
transcription (Li et al.2015b). It was shown that circSMARCA5 can introduce a
transcriptional pause at exon 15 of SMARCA5 by binding to the gene locus and
forming an R-loop, which is a complex hybrid DNA–RNA structure between the
gDNA and the circRNA, resulting in decreased expression of SMARCA5 transcript
and production of a truncated nonfunctional protein (Xu et al. 2020 ). Similarly,
circSEP3, derived from exon 6, can bind to its host DNA locus and form an R-loop,
through which it causes transcriptional pausing and induces the expression of the
cognate exon6-skipped alternative splicing variant of SEP3 (Conn et al. 2017 ).
Zhang et al. have provided evidence to indicate ciRNAs, spliced from lariats, can
accumulate at their synthesis sites and promote the expression of cognate genes
through regulating elongating Pol II activity (Zhang et al. 2013 ). For example,
ci-ankrd52, was shown to accumulate at its transcription sites and interacting with
Pol II, resulting in positive regulation ofankrd52transcription (Zhang et al. 2013 ).
Another study revealed that circMbl, spliced from the splicing factor MBL, com-
petes with canonical splicing of the cognate gene through binding to MBL protein
and modifying its abundance, which leads to altered mRNA splicing (Ashwal-Fluss
et al. 2014 ).

###### miRNA Sponges

There is increasing evidence to suggest that circRNA contains binding sites for
miRNA, and these binding sites can sequester miRNA and suppress their activity.
This allows circRNA to compete with mRNA for miRNA binding, thus acting as
competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA). The most established exemplar is CDR1
Antisense RNA gene (CDR1as), which contains more than 70 conserved binding
sites for miR-7. Reduced expression of CDR1as resulted in decreased levels of
mRNA targets of miR-7, supporting the capacity of CDR1as as a functional inhibitor
(Memczak et al. 2013 ; Hansen et al. 2013 ; Hansen et al. 2011 ). This function was
conserved across tissues and species; expression of human CDR1as in zebrafish
disrupted development of midbrain, which was similar to the phenotype observed for
miR-7 downregulation (Memczak et al. 2013 ). A testis-specific circRNA, circSRY,
harbors 16 target sites for miR-138 in mouse, and was experimentally confirmed to
interact with the miRNA (Hansen et al. 2013 ). Some circRNAs might, however,
contain target sites for multiple different miRNAs rather than a single molecule,
resulting in inhibition of a group of miRNAs. For example, circHIPK3 can sponge
nine miRNAs, including miR-124, it inhibits miR-124, and regulates human cell


254 E. Mahmoudi and M. J.Cairns

with miRNA

growth (Zheng et al. 2016 ). Similarly, circTCF25 was observed to sponge
miR-103a-3p/miR-107, resulting in increased expression of several target genes
associated with cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Zhong et al. 2016 ).
Depletion of circRNA-CER inhibited MMP13 expression through regulation of
miR-136, leading to the degradation of chondrocyte ECM (Liu et al. 2016 ). Several
investigations on circMTO1 indicated its roles in various cancer pathways through
inhibition of its target miRNAs including miR-9, miR-223, miR-630, and miR-92
(Li et al. 2020 ; Zhang et al.2019c). A recent report by Bronisz et al. indicated that
circ2082expression leads to aberrant nuclear localization of DICER, a complex
responsible for miRNA maturation, which in turn causes malfunctions in the post-
transcriptional maturation of the glioblastoma miRNAome and thus tumorigenicity
of glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo (Bronisz et al. 2020 ).
It has been suggested that the interaction of circRNA with miRNA may act
beyond inhibitory activity; for example, it may as also associate with sorting,
localization, and storage of miRNA molecules (Hansen et al. 2011 ; van Rossum
et al. 2016 ), see Fig.10.1.


10 CircRNA and Ageing 255

###### Modulator of Protein Activity and Expression

circRNAs are capable of modifying the activity of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)
and protein complexes by direct binding. For instance, circPABPN1 can target HuR,
an RBP which is a regulator of protein expression, and suppress its binding to
PABPN1 mRNA. This leads to decreased translation of PABPN1 (Abdelmohsen
et al. 2017 ). It was shown that interaction of circCcnb1 with Ccnb1 and Cdk1
proteins inhibited the formation of the Ccnb1–Cdk1 complex, which leads to
dysfunction of Ccnb1 and thus inhibition of tumor growth (Fang et al. 2019 ).
Furthermore, circCcnb1 can regulate cell death through association with H2AX
and wild-type p53, or otherwise forming a complex with H2AX and Bclaf1 (Fang
et al.2018a). circRNA are also implicated in assembly and activation of protein
complex, such as in case of circACC1 which increases activation of the
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex during metabolic stress (Li et al.
2019 ). In addition, circRNA may contribute to the intracellular localization and
transport of proteins; circAmotl1 was shown to associate with c-myc and enhance its
binding affinity to a number of promoters, thus regulating the expression of their
target genes (Bronisz et al. 2020 ). Finally, it was suggested that circRNA are capable
of regulating protein expression. For example, circYap was shown to negatively
modulate protein production of its cognate gene through inhibiting the assembly of
translation initiation machinery, without impacting the mRNA levels (Wu et al.
2019 ). Similarly, circPABPN1 was indicated to compete with its corresponding
mRNA for RBPs, through which it modulates translation rate of its target mRNA
(Abdelmohsen et al. 2017 ).

###### Encoding Functional Proteins

Although circRNA have largely been considered as noncoding molecules, several
reports have recently discovered that certain circRNA are, indeed, able to produce
functional proteins. Pamudurti and colleagues provided evidence for a group of
circRNAs able to be translated into proteins withinDrosophilaheads (Pamudurti
et al. 2017 ). Particularly, circMbl protein was detected in mass spectrometry data
which was found enriched in synaptosomes offly heads. circSHPRH was also
shown to produce a protein that was highly expressed in human brains and found
dysregulated in glioblastoma (Zhang et al.2018a). Similarly, circZNF609 was
revealed to encode a protein in murine and human myoblasts, capable of modifying
myoblast proliferation in response to stress (Legnini et al. 2017 ). Other examples
include circFBXW7 and circLINC-PINT that were reported to serve as protein
templates in brain tumors (Yang et al.2018b; Zhang et al.2018b), raising the
possibility of additional coding circRNAs that are yet to be identified. As the
identification of circRNA translation largely relies on back-spliced tags, it seems
necessary to introduce novel approaches to systematically discover translated


256 E. Mahmoudi and M. J. Cairns

circRNA. While the precise mechanism of their translation is not yet known, it has
been suggested that the presence of some elements such as artificial internal ribo-
somal entry sites (IRES) and infinite open reading frames (iORF, where there is no
stop codon on the circRNA) may promote their coding potential, possibly in a
cap-independent manner.

###### circRNA in Ageing

Expression profiling studies have provided evidence that indicate circRNA abun-
dance significantly increases throughout the lifespan in various organisms, and their
accumulation has been demonstrated specifically in brain tissues, suggesting a
biological role for circRNAs in the ageing process. These roles have been evident
by following studies where circRNA were shown to associate with various ageing
pathways whose impairment could lead to pathological conditions. As evidence,
there have been many age-related diseases in human that are associated with
circRNA expression, such as the case for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s
disease (PD), and diabetes.

###### circRNA Transcripts Accumulate During Ageing

A primary study by Gruner et al. profiled circRNA in the cortex, hippocampus, and
heart of 1- and 22-month old mice, revealing a global increase of circRNA abun-
dance in brain tissues of old mice as compared to the young ones (Gruner et al.
2016 ). However, the authors reported no change in aged heart circRNA, suggesting a
tissue-specific age accumulation of circRNA. Investigation of circRNA inC. elegans
during ageing, from the fourth larval stage through 10-day-old adults, displayed a
significant accumulation of circRNA among the ageing time-points, with some
transcripts observed to have over 40-fold change (Cortés-López et al. 2018 ). Nota-
bly, several of these circRNAs were produced from genes involved in the determi-
nation of lifespan (Cortés-López et al. 2018 ). A comprehensive profiling of circRNA
was performed inDrosophilacovering various developmental stages, tissues, and
cultured cells. The results uncovered an increase in circRNA accumulation across
embryonic development, enhanced accumulation in larval/pupal CNS compared to
other tissues of these stages, and a predominant accumulation of circRNA in adult
CNS relative to all other samples (Westholm et al. 2014 ). The study suggested the
observed progressive accumulation may affect brain function, and also represent
promising ageing biomarkers in the CNS. Similarly, transcriptome analysis of
circRNA in whole body of ageing rat confirmed a substantial increase of circRNA
abundance with age in the rat brain relative to other tissues (Mahmoudi and Cairns
2019 ; Zhou et al. 2018 ).


10 CircRNA and Ageing 257

###### Mechanisms of circRNA Accumulation

The above-mentioned studies demonstrated that circRNA age accumulation is
independent of their cognate linear isoforms, indicating they are not the conse-
quences of higher transcription of their host genes. While the mechanisms underly-
ing the circRNA accumulation are not clearly known, it has been suggested that the
closed structure of circRNA transcripts that lack a free 3’and 5’end allows them to
escape molecular digestion by cellular exonuclease (Jeck and Sharpless 2014 ). The
resulting stability was shown to be significantly higher than the linear counterpart,
with the half-life estimated to be over 48 hours (Jeck and Sharpless 2014 ). In
addition, it has been proposed that changes in alternative splicing during ageing
could also associate with enhanced back-splicing events (Cortés-López and Miura
2016 ). This contribution seems plausible, particularly given the recent reports
implicating splicing factors FUS (Errichelli et al. 2017 ) and QKI (Conn et al.
2015 ) in biogenesis of circRNA.

###### Biological Roles of circRNA in Ageing

Characterization of circRNA functions in ageing have revealed biological signifi-
cance of these molecules in the physiology of ageing and cellular senescence. For
instance, circPVT1 expression can inhibit cellular senescence by sequestering
miRNA let-7 and increasing its target genes, KRAS, IGF2BP1, and HMGA2, that
are proliferative proteins (Panda et al. 2017 ). circFOXO3 was shown to sequester
proteins, including ID-1, E2F1, FAK, and HIF-1a, which are implicated in cellular
stress pathways and induced cardiac senescence (Du et al. 2017 ). It was found that
circRNA-0077930 induced the senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells in
human umbilical vein endothelial cell exosomes by suppressing miR-622 and
inducing Kras, p21, p53, and p16 expressions (Wang et al.2020b). A study of
circRNA in muscle ageing and exercise in mice revealed that circBBS9 and its target
gene pathways were altered by the advance of age but restored by aerobic exercise
(Guo et al. 2020 ). Furthermore, overexpression of circBBS9 in differentiated C2C12
myotubes induced the genes involved in the predicted pathways and decreased
muscle atrophic genes including Foxo3 and Atrogin, as well as elevated functional
mitochondrial genes, Pgc1α, Mfn1, and Atpase. The authors suggested that
circBBS9 overexpression enhances muscle functionality gene programs and may
associate with the muscle ageing process. Transcriptome analysis in young and
prematurely senescent human fibroblast 2BS cells discovered a senescence-
associated circRNA, circCCNB1. Knockdown of this circRNA inhibited CCNE2
expression through sequestering miR-449a activity, which led to the trigged senes-
cence in young 2BSfibroblasts, suggesting circCCNB1-miR-449a-CCNE2 axis as a
key in cellular senescence (Yu et al. 2019 ). Cheng et al. explored circRNA alter-
ations in human granulosa cells (GCs) during maternal ageing and uncovered


258 E. Mahmoudi and M. J. Cairns

age-related circRNA variations by showing 46 upregulated and 11 downregulated
circRNAs in advanced ageing samples (Cheng et al. 2017 ). Following gonadotropin
treatment adjustment, they particularly found circRNA_103827 and
circRNA_104816 levels were positively associated with maternal age. Furthermore,
enhanced expressions of these circRNAs were related to declining ovarian reserve
and adverse reproductive outcomes. Another report in ageing human blood found
that the conserved circRNAs circDEF6, circEP300, circFOXO3 and circFNDC3B,
are implicated in parental longevity or hand grip strength (Haque et al.2020b).
Moreover, circFOXO3 and circEP300 demonstrated dysregulated expression in
human senescent cells. In addition, circPlekhm1 expression level in spleen was
shown to be positively associated with mouse lifespan (Haque et al.2020b). An
exciting in vivo study has recently revealed a critical role for a circRNA encoded by
sulfateless gene, known as circSfl, in ageing (Weigelt et al. 2020 ). circSflwas shown
to extend the lifespan ofDrosophila in long-lived insulin mutantflies, where
overexpression of CircSflresulted in increased lifespan, particularly in muscles
and the brain. Further functional experiments indicated circSflis translated into a
peptide that is sufficient to extend lifespan (Weigelt et al. 2020 ). This study also
indicated that neuronal circRNA accumulation with age is malleable and decreased
in long-lived insulin mutants.

###### circRNA in Age-Associated Disease

Since ageing is associated with a functional decline of cells, tissues, and organs, it
results in the occurrence of various related diseases, such as neurological disorders,
cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and others. As key regulators of cellular functions,
circRNA have been shown to play roles in ageing-related pathways, and hence
represent a potential contributor to development of age-associated diseases. The
main mechanisms through which circRNA might contribute to this is through the
circRNA–miRNA–mRNA regulatory axis and by circRNA–protein interactions.

###### CircRNA in Neurological Disorders

circRNAs are enriched in central nervous system (CNS), and also accumulate with
the progression of age, suggesting that they play physiological and pathological roles
in ageing CNS. Lukiw reported a dysregulation of CDR1as (ciRS-7) expression in
hippocampal CA1 region of patients with sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (Lukiw
2013 ). Following studies found that reduced expression of CDR1as leads to an
increased level of miR-7 which in turn suppresses the level of UBE2A, a protein
essential in the clearance of amyloid peptides in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain
(Zhao et al. 2016 ). CDR1as expression was also shown to promote APP and BACE1
degradation in a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent manner (Shi et al. 2017 ).


10 CircRNA and Ageing 259

Interestingly, the CDR1as-miR-7 role has also been detected in pathology of
Parkinson’s Disease (PD), where high levels of CDR1as sequester miR-7, resulting
in an increased level ofα-synuclein protein, which is conducive to PD. Reduced
abundance of circRNA was observed in PD SN (substantia nigra), and differential
expression analysis revealed circSLC8A1 was upregulated in SN of PD patients with
a potential to regulate miR-128 activity (Hanan et al. 2020 ). CircSLC8A1 expression
was also induced in cultured cells exposed to oxidative stress but reduced in cells
treated with neuroprotective antioxidants suggesting a link between circSLC8A1
and oxidative stress-related Parkinsonism.
Wu et al. uncovered a critical role for circTLK1 in ischemic stroke, where high
expression of circTLK1 results in inhibition of miR-335-3p activity, and thus
increasing ADP-ribose polymerase expression and neuronal injury. Similarly,
circDLGAP4 was reduced in the plasma of acute ischemic stroke patients and in a
mouse stroke model, causing a reduction in miR-143 targeted sponging and the
corresponding reduction of HECT Domain E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase
1 (HECTD1) expression, which is a target of miR-143 (Bai et al. 2018 ). circRNA-
0067835 levels were decreased in tissues and plasma from temporal lobe epilepsy
(TLE) patients, and it was shown to modulate refractory epilepsy progression by
acting as a sponge of miR-155 to increase FOXO3a transcript level (Gong et al.
2018 ). It was demonstrated that circEFCAB2 and circDROSHA can act as sponges
for miR-48-5P and miR-1252-5P, respectively, to regulate the expression of target
genes and impact TLE pathogenesis (Li et al.2018). Dysregulation of many other
circRNAs was reported in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), and two
circRNAs, circ_Arhgap4 and circ_Nav3, were found to regulate miR-6328 and
miR-10b-3p levels, respectively (Gomes-Duarte et al. 2021 ).

###### CircRNA in Cardiovascular Diseases

Several lines of evidence have revealed the contribution of circRNA in the devel-
opment of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD), athero-
sclerosis, heart failure, and myocardial infarction (Tang et al. 2021 ). For example,
dysregulation of a total of 171 and 624 circRNAs were reported in patients with
CHD as compared to control groups (Wang et al.2019b). Increased levels of
circWDR77 and circRUSC2 cause disordered proliferation and migration of vascu-
lar smooth muscle cells by targeting miR-124/FGF-2 and miR-661/ SYK axes,
respectively, which lead to the induced pathological process of atherosclerosis
(Chen et al.2017a; Sun et al. 2019 ). It was shown that upregulation of circSLC8A1
inhibits miR-133a to induce the target genes of the miRNA in cardiomyocytes,
indicating its implication in cardiac hypertrophy (Lim et al. 2019 ). Wang et al
showed circ-HRCR could suppress cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure by seques-
tering miR-223 (Wang et al. 2016 ). Downregulation of circ-Fndc3b was observed in
post-myocardial infarction heart tissue, where circ-Fndc3b interaction with FUS
regulates the level of VEGF, resulting in modulation of cardiac repair after


260 E. Mahmoudi and M. J. Cairns

myocardial infarction (Garikipati et al. 2019 ). In addition, circ-Hipk3 interaction
with Notch1 protein, which elevated the stability of N1ICD, and also with miR-133a
led to improved cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction in mice (Si et al.
2020 ).

###### CircRNA in Cancer

Ageing is a major risk factor for cancer development, and due to their shared
mechanisms, such as genomic instability, telomere attrition, and epigenetic changes,
cancer is also considered an ageing disease (Aunan et al. 2017 ). Accumulating
evidence have indicated an essential role for circRNA in development of various
cancers such as glioblastoma, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), prostate
cancer, and others. For instance, CircNT5E was found to induce glioblastoma
tumorigenesis by inhibiting the activity of miR-422a and controlling cell prolifera-
tion, migration, and invasion (Wang et al. 2018 ). In lung cancer, circITCH acts as
tumor suppressor by enhancing ITCH levels through sequestering oncogenic miR-7
and miR-214 and thus inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Wan et al. 2016 ). A
report by Chen et al. revealed that circRNA production was associated with disease
progression in patients with prostate cancer, with 11.3% of highly abundant
circRNAs found essential for cell proliferation (Chen et al. 2019 ). Functional
characterization of individual circRNAs also showed circCSNK1G3 can drive
prostate cancer cell proliferation via interacting with miR-181, and impact the
expression of CBX7, CDK1, and CDC25A. A regulatory mechanism by circRNA-
MTO1 was demonstrated to control cell viability and monastrol resistance in breast
cancer; upregulation of circRNA-MTO1 inhibited cell viability, enhanced
monastrol-induced cell cytotoxicity, and reversed monastrol resistance by seques-
tering TRAF4 from activating Eg5 translation, thereby suppressing the Eg5 protein
level (Liu et al. 2018 ). Efforts in HCC have shown circRHOT1, as an upregulated
circRNA in HCC tissues, enhances HCC progression by recruiting TIP60 to the
NR2F6 promoter and initiating NR2F6 transcription (Wang et al.2019a). Ma et al.
found a dramatic downregulation of hsa_circ_0004872 in gastric cancer tissues,
which was associated with tumor size and local lymph node metastasis (Ma et al.
2020 ). While hsa_circ_0004872 induced p21 and Smad4 expression via sponging
miR-224, Smad4 could further modulate hsa_circ_0004872 expression by binding
to the ADAR1 promoter and decreasing its transcription, resulting in forming a
miR-224/Smad4/ADAR1/hsa_circ_0004872 negative regulatory circuit to control
cancer progression (Ma et al. 2020 ).


10 CircRNA and Ageing 261

###### CircRNA in Diabetes

Due to the elevated insulin resistance and impaired pancreatic islet function with
ageing, older adults are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and circRNAs
have been reported to play a pathological role in this disease. The expression
analysis of circRNAs in peripheral leucocytes of patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) and healthy controls identified 220 differentially expressed
circRNAs (107 upregulated and 113 downregulated) (Fang et al.2018b). Further
investigation showed circANKRD36 level was positively associated with glucose
and glycosylated hemoglobin, as well as with IL-6 expression, suggesting
circANKRD36 is involved in T2DM possibly through interaction with IL-6
targeting miRNAs, including hsa-miR-3614-3p, hsa-miR-501-5p, and hsa-miR-
498 (Fang et al.2018b). A study by Haque and colleagues indicated four circRNAs,
including circCIRBP, circZKSCAN, circRPH3AL, and circCAMSAP1, were asso-
ciated with diabetes status; CircCIRBP was involved in insulin secretory index in
human islets, and circCIRBP and circRPH3AL were linked to increased fatty acid in
treated EndoC-βH1 cells (Haque et al.2020a). Moreover, CircCAMSAP1 expres-
sion was correlated with T2D status in human peripheral blood. It was found that
Hsa_circ_0054633 is differentially expressed in peripheral blood of T2DM patients,
and also presented promising diagnostic capability for pre-diabetes and T2DM
(Zhao et al.2017b).

###### CircRNA as Biomarkers for Ageing

The emerging evidence on the implication of circRNA expression in ageing and their
biological regulatory roles in ageing processes and related diseases suggests diag-
nostic and prognostic values for circRNA in normal and pathological ageing. Special
features include consistent accumulation in various animals, high stability and
conservation, tissue and stage specificity, as well as their presence in accessible
tissues such as plasma (Zhang et al. 2017 ), serum (Gu et al. 2017 ), saliva (Bahn et al.
2015 ), and exosomes (Li et al.2015a) support consideration of circRNA as reliable
biomarkers. A recent attempt to investigate the circRNA capability of age prediction
in human blood using multiple machine learning models suggested that circRNAs
are promising for age prediction (Wang et al.2020a). Using the blood of thirteen
unrelated healthy individuals aged 20–62 years, a strong upregulation was observed
during ageing in human blood, and seven circRNAs were further validated in a larger
cohort of 50 healthy subjects and subsequently used forfinal prediction models. The
results suggested that circRNA may have application as indicators of ageing in
forensic samples due to their unique degradation-resistant molecular structure
(Wang et al.2020a). circRNAs can also be biomarkers for age-related diseases
that advance with age. In such cases, circRNA can facilitate early diagnosis and
also determine the stage and subtype of the disease, which would be useful in


262 E. Mahmoudi and M. J. Cairns

selecting the treatment options and curation of disorder. They may also be beneficial
in prediction of treatment outcomes or used as treatment targets, resulting in the
better management of disease. In support of this, experimental evidence has
suggested that circRNA’s may serve as diagnostic and prognostic factors. For
instance, Cdr1as expression is differentially expressed in AD and PD patients
relative to healthy controls. A diagnostic analysis using blood circUBXN7 and
circLMO1 distinguished patients with gastric cancer from healthy group (Han
et al. 2020 ). In HCC, plasma circRNA panels including circHPCAL1,
circRABGGTA, and circMTM displayed a high diagnostic accuracy in detecting
patients with cancer from healthy and HCC precursor control patients (Yu et al.
2020 ). Weng et al. found Cdr1as a prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer patients
(Weng et al. 2017 ). Also, circZKSCAN1 expression was related to poor prognosis
and clinical stage in lung cancer (Wang et al.2019c) and to good prognosis in
bladder cancer (Bi et al. 2019 ). It was identified that circCNOT2 is a prognostic
biomarker of aromatase inhibitor therapy in advanced breast cancer (Smid et al.
2019 ). In coronary artery diseasehttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/
S0735109718336167, blood hsa_circ_0124644 could discriminate CAD patients
from healthy controls (Zhao et al.2017a).
Current methodologies also support accurate measurement of circRNA which is
essential for biomarker application. High-throughput sequencing, particularly with
RNAase R depletion, along with circRNA-specific prediction algorithms enable a
precise quantification of circular transcripts. In addition, RT-qPCR platform using
divergent primers can take advantage of back-spliced junction tags to specifically
and accurately quantify circRNAs at the individual level. It is also possible to
costume design microarray chips or qPCR panels to detect the transcript’s level
for a set of circRNAs of interest.

###### Perspectives and Conclusions

Emerging evidence that circular RNA transcripts increase with age in various
animals, suggests they may have a conserved role in ageing and lifespan. However,
their regulatory mechanism is very much an open question. We also do not know if
circRNAs contribute causally to the ageing process, or if they have protective or
pro-ageing effects. Understanding these impacts would allow perturbation of
circRNA molecules in order to potentially slow down ageing process and increase
lifespan. In support of this, it was shown that ectopic expression of circSflresulted in
extended lifespan ofDrosophilain long-lived insulin-mutantflies (Weigelt et al.
2020 ).
Despite comprehensive analyses of circRNAs in various animal models of
ageing, the circRNA transcriptome has not been explored in human ageing. This
should be a high priority for thefield as it would shed light on the contribution of
circRNA to the genomic hallmarks of ageing. In addition, study of circRNA


10 CircRNA and Ageing 263

alteration in ageing humans could also help identify ageing markers which would be
beneficial in human forensic investigations.
Given the implication of circRNA expression in age-associated disease, it is
plausible that they could serve as novel molecular markers for diagnosis, prognosis,
therapeutic evaluation, and also as treatment agents. Several studies in cancer and
heart disease have supported the idea that circRNA levels in circulating bodyfluids
have predictive capabilities to distinguish patients from healthy individuals (Han
et al. 2020 ; Yu et al. 2020 ; Weng et al.2017; Wang et al.2019c; Bi et al. 2019 ; Smid
et al. 2019 ; Zhao et al.2017a). Chen and colleagues showed that circPVT1 was an
independent marker for overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with
gastric cancer (Chen et al.2017b). Specifically, cell- and stage-specificity of
circRNA may also extend the clinical application of these molecules to identifying
subtypes or phases of development of human disease. For example, circRNA
expression was found associated with three subtypes of breast cancer (Nair et al.
2016 ). Considering the fast development of circRNA studies along with specific
technical methods, as well as the promising outcomes so far, it is credible to
anticipate that there will be more circRNA-based clinical approaches introduced in
the future.
In conclusion, circRNAs appear to be key molecules in regulation of ageing
physiology as well as in pathological conditions associated with ageing. They exert
their functions through diverse regulatory mechanisms, particularly miRNA spong-
ing. However, similar to otherfields, circRNA investigations in ageing are still in
their infancy, and the functional relevance of the majority of circRNAs is yet to be
uncovered in ageing process.

#### Extracellular Vesicles and Cellular Ageing

Nekane Romero-García, Cristina Mas-Bargues, Javier Huete-Acevedo,
and Consuelo Borrás

Abstract Ageing is a complex process characterized by deteriorated performance at
multiple levels, starting from cellular dysfunction to organ degeneration. Stem cell-
based therapies aim to administrate stem cells that eventually migrate to the injured
site to replenish the damaged tissue and recover tissue functionality. Stem cells can
be easily obtained and cultured in vitro, and display several qualities such as self-
renewal, differentiation, and immunomodulation that make them suitable candidates
for stem cell-based therapies. Current animal studies and clinical trials are being
performed to assess the safety and beneficial effects of stem cell engraftments for
regenerative medicine in ageing and age-related diseases.
Since alterations in cell–cell communication have been associated with the
development of pathophysiological processes, new research is focusing on the
modulation of the microenvironment. Recent research has highlighted the important
role of some microenvironment components that modulate cell–cell communication,
thus spreading signals from damaged ageing cells to neighbor healthy cells, thereby
promoting systemic ageing. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small-rounded vesicles
released by almost every cell type. EVs cargo includes several bioactive molecules,
such as lipids, proteins, and genetic material. Once internalized by target cells, their
specific cargo can induce epigenetic modifications and alter the fate of the recipient
cells. Also, EV’s content is dependent on the releasing cells, thus, EVs can be used
as biomarkers for several diseases. Moreover, EVs have been proposed to be used as
cell-free therapies that focus on their administration to slow or even reverse some
hallmarks of physiological ageing. It is not surprising that EVs are also under study
as next-generation therapies for age-related diseases.

###### Intercellular Communication

###### Homeostasis and Intercellular Communication

Intercellular communication is a biologicalprocess necessary for the maintenance of
homeostasis in the organism that relieson coordination between cells to complete
their functions. It is crucial in the development, differentiation, and adaptation of
cells to their environment (Armingol et al. 2021 ; Mittelbrunn and Sánchez-Madrid
2012 ; Song et al. 2019 ). Alterations in cell–cell communication are implicated in the
development of pathophysiological processes in the organism such as tumorigenesis,
metastasis, autoimmunity, senescence, and also in physiological processes such as
ageing (Yang et al. 2021 ); concepts that we will develop in the chapter.
Intercellular communication generally requires the exchange of biochemical
substances (ions, metabolites, hormones, cytokines, etc.) between them. This type
of communication is called biochemical communication. There are two types of
biochemical communication: direct and indirect (Fig.11.1).

Fig. 11.1 The two types of biochemical communication. Direct cell communication is mediated by
cell adhesion molecules, gap junctions, or by tunneling nanotubes. Indirect cellular communication
includes paracrine, autocrine, and endocrine signaling. Effector cells (yellow) transmit signaling
molecules to target cells (green). Created withBioRender.com


11 Extracellular Vesicles and Cellular Ageing 273

- Direct, contact-dependent, or juxtacrine communication occurs between neigh-
    boring cells near each other in which their membrane structures facilitate the
    exchange of moleculeswithout thesebeing secreted into the extracellular space.
    In turn, there are three direct biochemical communication pathways:
    - Communication mediated by cell adhesion molecules (selectins, integrins,
       cadherins, and immunoglobulins).
    - Communication mediated by gap junctions.
    - Communication mediated by tunneling nanotubes, which are thin projections
       of the plasma membrane.
- Indirect communication is characterized by the secretion of signaling molecules
    that are transported byflow or diffusion. These molecules are secreted freely and
    can either diffuse passively across the membrane (hydrophobic small molecules)
    or be transported into the cytoplasm of the target cell by endocytosis (hydrophilic
    molecules). However, there is another type of indirect communication in which
    the secretory cell releases extracellular vesicles containing the signaling mole-
    cules. Depending on the distance between the secretory cell and the target cell,
    indirect communication can be classified as follows:
    - Paracrine, in which communication only affects cells in the immediate neigh-
       borhood of the secretory cell.
    - Autocrine, in which the signals are directed to the cells that secrete them.
    - Endocrine, long-distance communication in which signaling molecules travel
       through the systemic circulation to reach the target cells (Armingol et al. 2021 ;
       Yang et al. 2021 ).
    In addition to biochemical communication, there is also mechanical communica-
tion. Here, cells communicate with their surroundings by exerting mechanical forces
on the extracellular matrix. These signals are involved in various processes such as
cytoskeleton reorganization and cell migration (Van Helvert et al. 2018 ), matrix
remodeling (Swartz et al. 2001 ), epigenetic modifications (Yang et al. 2021 ), or
recruitment of immune cells to the tissue (Pakshir et al. 2019 ) among others.

###### Intercellular Communication and Ageing

Ageing involves changes in cell–cell communication, mainly due to increased
cellular senescence. Senescence is implicated not only in ageing but also in
age-related diseases such as cancer, arthritis, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's dis-
ease. The main characteristic of senescence is the stable arrest of the cell cycle;
however, its influence on tissue homeostasis and the development of age-related
pathologies is due to the Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP
can be considered a type of intercellular communication specific to senescent cells
that are characterized by abundant secretion of molecules of diverse nature such as


274 N. Romero-García et al.

cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases. Recently,
new components of the SASP such as extracellular vesicles, metabolites, and ions
have been discovered (Cuollo et al. 2020 ;Fafián-Labora and O'Loghlen 2020 ;
López-Otín et al. 2013 ).
It should be noted that the profile of secreted molecules of SAPS is diverse and
depends on the tissue context. Sometimes SASP plays a beneficial role in tissue
physiology as it is involved in the removal of senescent cells from tissue and is thus
related to the maintenance of homeostasis and tissue regeneration. In addition, SASP
is involved in the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells in the vicinity of
tumor cells and premalignant lesions (Cuollo et al. 2020 ;Fafián-Labora and
O'Loghlen 2020 ; Olivieri et al. 2018 ). SASP components involved in these functions
are regulated by p53 and include nerve growth factor inducible (VGF), or insulin-
like growth factor-binding protein (IGFB) (Lopes-Paciencia et al. 2019 ).
Despite this, ageing increases the number of senescent cells and alters the type of
molecules secreted from the SASP and thus intercellular communication. In this
situation, SASP plays a detrimental role in tissues and is associated with the
development of age-related diseases (Cuollo et al. 2020 ; Olivieri et al. 2018 ). The
components of SASP in ageing can be classified as pro-inflammatory,
pro-oncogenic, paracrine senescent, and autocrine senescent.

###### SASP and Its Pro-inflammatory Components: Age-Related

###### Inflammation

The C/EBP family of transcription factors and mainly the NF-κB factor regulate the
secretion of cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors such as Interleukin-1β(IL-1β),
IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, chemokine“C-X-C motif”ligand 1 (CXCL1), or transforming
growth factorβ1 (TGFβ1) among others, which contribute to the development of a
chronic and systemic inflammation process known as“inflammageing”(Franceschi
and Campisi 2014 ). This inflammageing situation contributes to the development
of age-related diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and
Alzheimer's disease. In addition, inflammageing and stress-mediated inflammatory
responses are associated with activation of the NF-κB pathway in the hypothalamus
and induce a signaling pathway that results in reduced production of gonadotropin-
releasing hormone (GnRH). Decreased GnRH has been shown to contribute to
age-related physiological alterations including bone fragility, muscle weakness,
skin atrophy, and reduced neurogenesis (Zhang et al. 2013 ).
Other studies, such as those of Pont and colleagues, link inflammation to ageing
through the AUF1 factor (Pont et al. 2012 ). This factor is responsible for the
degradation of the messenger RNA of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
tumor necrosis factorα(TNFα) and IL-1β(Lu et al. 2006 ), and is therefore involved
in halting the inflammatory response. In addition, AUF1 has also been found to be
involved in the activation of the expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase,
which means that it contributes to maintaining telomere length. A reduction in the


11 Extracellular Vesicles and Cellular Ageing 275

expression of this factor, therefore, contributes to inflammageing, increased cellular
senescence, and premature ageing.
At the same time as the age-related chronic inflammation situation, the function of
the immune system is increasingly impaired in ageing. This makes it more difficult
to effectively eliminate pathogens and dysfunctional cells from tissues such as
senescent cells. This leads to an accumulation of senescent cells in tissues resulting
in an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and thus chronic inflammation.

###### SASP and Pro-oncogenic Components

The SASP in ageing is also formed by enzymes involved in the reorganization of the
extracellular matrix such as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These enzymes,
in addition to reorganizing the extracellular matrix, are responsible for processing
chemokines in tissues. Therefore, the secretion of these proteases reduces the
recruitment of macrophages that are responsible for eliminating senescent cells,
thus increasing senescence in tissues (Fig.11.2). In addition, this results in reduced

Fig. 11.2 Types of SASP components. SASP components that mediate autocrine senescence are
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and -8 (IL-8). SASP components that promote paracrine senescence include
interleukin-1β(IL-1β), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), and damage-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs). SASP components can also spread pro-oncogenic effects through matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs), IL-6, and IL-8; as well as pro-inflammatory effects through IL-1β,
IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, chemokine“C-X-C motif”ligand 1 (CXCL1), and TGF-β1. Created with

immune surveillance which, together with the immunosenescence characteristic of
ageing, results in the body's inability to detect cells on the verge of malignant
transformation (Lopes-Paciencia et al. 2019 ; López-Otín et al. 2013 ). IL-6 and
IL-8 have also been found to have protumorigenic effects on cells in the vicinity
of the senescent cell. That is, paracrine protumorigenic activity (Kuilman et al. 2008 ;
Pietras et al. 2013 ). Consequently, SASP can also lead, in addition to chronic
inflammation, to the development of tumors.

###### SASP and Paracrine Senescence

Acosta et al. ( 2013 ) demonstrated that there is a paracrine transmission of senescence
from senescent cells with SASP to neighboring normal. However, this can spread
locally with limitations, as the authors obtained results indicating that controls may
exist to prevent the uncontrolled spread of senescence through an organ or tissue.
The main components of SASP capable of triggering paracrine senescence are IL-1β
and TGF-β(Pont et al. 2012 ). Senescent cells can also secrete damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs) capable of inducing paracrine senescence (Lopes-
Paciencia et al. 2019 ).

###### SASP and Autocrine Senescence

The factors IL-6 and IL-8, which are part of the SASP, are capable of forcing cell
cycle arrest of the senescent cell that secretes them, accentuating the senescence of
this cell (Lopes-Paciencia et al. 2019 ; Pietras et al. 2013 ).
In short, ageing is a process that not only affects cells but also their communica-
tion. It is worth noting that there are currently therapeutic strategies that act in this
sense, senomorphics. These are drugs that neutralize the detrimental effects of cell
communication in ageing, i.e., they reduce SASP without killing senescent cells as
senolytics do. Senomorphics, therefore, offers an opportunity to modulate and
mitigate the deleterious effects of ageing at the level of cell communication. Despite
this, intercellular communication is very complex, highlighting the need for further
research in thisfield to improve the prospects for patients suffering from these
pathologies.

###### Stem Cells for Regenerative Medicine

###### Introduction to Stem Cells

A stem cell is presented as one that divides asymmetrically to produce a copy of
itself and a second cell that is on its path to differentiate (Martinez-Agosto et al.


11 Extracellular Vesicles and Cellular Ageing 277

2007 ). The definition of a stem cell inevitably requires an assessment of its potential
to give rise to several differentiated progenies. Therefore, according to their potency,
stem cells can be divided into totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, and unipotent.
Stem cells can also be classified according to their origin into two groups: embryonic
stem cells (ESCs) and adult stem cells (ASCs). ESCs are pluripotent cells that can
give rise to cells from the three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm
(Amit et al. 2000 ; Itskovitz-Eldor et al. 2000 ; Reubinoff et al. 2000 ; Schuldiner et al.
2000 ). Adult stem cells (ASCs) can give rise to mature cell types within the same
germ layer: ectodermal cells will give rise to skin and neurons; mesodermal cells will
generate cardiac, muscle, blood, and bone cells; and endodermal cells will produce
visceral cells, such as pancreatic, lung, kidney, or thyroid cells.
In the adult organism, ASCs reside in niches. Several niches have been identified
in almost all adult tissues: lungs, skin, adipose tissue, vasculature, heart, central
nervous system, liver, pancreas, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, endometrium, mus-
cle, bone marrow, oral tissues, etc. (Mas-Bargues et al. 2019 ). All of them being
potential sources of stem cells. Thus, ASCs can be easily obtained for regenerative
therapies.
Several strategies have been employed to induce the conversion of differentiated
cells into an embryonic state. All these approaches led to the generation of a new cell
type, commonly referred to as“induced pluripotent stem cells”or iPSCs. The iPSCs
are reprogrammed from differentiated somatic cells by going back to an
undifferentiated state similar to ESCs. Both ESCs and iPSCs are defined as plurip-
otent and can differentiate into three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ecto-
derm) as well as self-renew. Thus, iPSCs can also be used for regenerative therapies.
The usage of ASCs and iPSCs in cell-based therapies has advantages and
disadvantages. The ideal stem cell for transplantation should be obtained from an
easy-access source, with high and fast expansion rates in vitro, long-term survival
capacity, immunologically inert for a successful host integration, and able to differ-
entiate in situ to replace the damaged cells (Kim and Park 2017 ). Although iPSCs
have a higher replicative lifespan and differentiation potential, this feature has been
associated with an increased formation of teratomas following iPSCs administration
(Deng et al. 2018 ; Iida et al. 2017 ), whereas ASCs are non-tumorigenic when
transplanted in vivo (Itakura et al. 2017 ). Another key point is the ability to attach
to the target site, which has been directly related to their growth and differentiation
(Lam and Longaker 2012 ). In this context, ASCs displayed better migration and
engraftment than iPSCs. Indeed, ASCs are the preferred cells for cell-based
therapies.

###### Importance of Stem Cell Culture Conditions for Clinical

###### Applications

Any regenerative therapy using ASCs or iPSCs needs a very high number of cells
which can only be achieved by a long-term in vitro culture. During this expansion


278 N. Romero-García et al.

stage, stem cells can enter a senescence state, where they cease to proliferate and lose
the ability to differentiate (Alves-Paiva et al. 2022 ). For this reason, in vitro culture
conditions must be considered to obtain good-quality stem cells that can be used in
cell therapies. Currently, stem cell expansion is mostly achieved via the conventional
platform and protocol: tissue culture plastic (TCP) and 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) in 21% O 2 /5% CO 2 incubators. This combination has been a gold standard in
obtaining millions of cells, but clinical studies require a new protocol for SCs
expansion. Recently, new culture systems, reduced oxygen tensions, and media
preconditioning have proven to improve stem cell proliferation and differentiation
potentials toward a better outcome for regenerative therapies.
Stem cell culture systems can be two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional
(3D) (Abdollahi 2021 ). 2D systems include common polystyreneflasks, whereas
3D systems mainly consist of bioreactors, such as two-chamber or hollow-fiber
bioreactors, in which stem cells can be grown in higher densities (Gobin et al.
2021 ). Furthermore, 3D systems can capture physiological aspects that are missing
in conventional 2D systems, such as tissue architecture, extracellular matrix com-
position, and heterotypic cell–cell interactions (Ader and Tanaka 2014 ). Indeed, a
study suggested a decellularized extracellular matrix as an improved cell expansion
setting for ASCs derived from bone marrow aspirates (Van et al. 2019 ). Another
recent study reported that a gravity-controlled environment could enhance the
proliferation and differentiation of ASCs (Nakaji-Hirabayashi et al. 2022 ). More-
over, there are several bioengineering strategies to create 3D constructs from iPSCs
(Varzideh et al. 2022 ).
Most conventional in vitro cell cultures are performed under ambient oxygen
concentration (20–21% pO 2 ), which is often referred to as“normoxia.”In contrast,
in vivo ASCs are not exposed to such a high concentration of oxygen. ASCs are
developed in environments with low oxygen tension, that ranges between 0 and 1%
pO 2 in the bone marrow (Chow et al. 2001 ; Harrison et al. 2002 ), to 13–18% pO 2 in
blood and lungs (Steurer et al. 1997 ). Keeley and Mann ( 2019 ) published a com-
prehensive review of the specific oxygen concentration for each tissue of the human
body and concluded that an average range of 3–6% pO 2 would be considered as the
physiological normoxia in which cells should be cultured in vitro. Indeed, culturing
ASCs derived from dental pulps at 3% pO 2 proved to maintain their proliferation
rate, differentiation capacity, and stemness potential compared to those cultured at
21% pO 2 (El Alami et al. 2014 ; Mas-Bargues et al. 2017 , 2019). Moreover, it has
been reported that low oxygen tension improves ASCs adhesion, proliferation, and
differentiation in 3D scaffolds (Vina-Almunia et al. 2017 ). It is interesting to note
that cultivating ASCs under physiological normoxia before transplantation improves
tissue regenerative potential (Chen et al. 2022 ; Rosova et al. 2008 ).
Media preconditioning consists in activating cytoprotective pathways by either
exposing cells to a sublethal environment (Hu et al. 2008 ), or by transfecting cells
with survival genes (Zhang et al. 2008 ), or by conditioning cells with pharmacolog-
ical molecules to activate specific cellular survival pathways. Among these pharma-
cological agents, oxytocin, celasterol, or melatonin have been commonly used
(Noiseux et al. 2012 ; Touani et al. 2021 ; Zhao et al. 2015 ). As an example,


11 Extracellular Vesicles and Cellular Ageing 279

in vitro studies have demonstrated that melatonin exerts antioxidant and
antiapoptotic effects on MSCs, thereby improving the outcome of stem cell trans-
plantation (Lee et al. 2019 ; Zhang et al.2017a). Melatonin in transplanted mice
promoted neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation into oligodendrocytes and
astrocytes while reducing oxidative stress (Mendivil-Perez et al. 2017 ).

###### Stem Cells in Clinical Trials

Stem Cell Properties Supporting Their Clinical Application

Among ASCs, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the most used in clinical trials.
The therapeutic potential of MSCs includes their ability to differentiate into various
cell lineages, modulate the immune response, and migrate to the exact site of injury.
Several in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that MSCs can differentiate into
bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, tendon, and bone marrow cells (Okolicsanyi et al. 2015 ;
Zheng et al. 2013 ). MSCs’fate is regulated by specific signals from their microen-
vironment, which includes biological molecules and biomechanical forces. These
factors play a key role in determining MSCs differentiation and thus, their contri-
bution to the repair process (Han et al.2019). Indeed, MSCs-based therapies must
ensure that the host microenvironment meets the requirements for the specific type of
cell. It has been reported that the host environment led to the development of cell
types other than those needed for the therapy (Ponticiello et al. 2000 ).
MSCs can modulate the immune system; MSCs can interact with both the innate
and adaptive immune systems, leading to the modulation of several effector func-
tions. Indeed, both in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that MSCs can interact
directly with lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells to
prevent an excessive immune response (Han et al. 2012 ; Uccelli et al. 2008 ). This is
of utmost importance regarding graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), a syndrome that
is characterized by systemic inflammation. For instance, donor-derived MSCs have
been shown to induce long-term allograft acceptance in a rat model of heart
transplantation (Popp et al. 2008 ). Although to prevent GVHD, the best solution is
to use autologous stem cell transplants.
The homing ability of MSCs relies on their ability to migrate to the target tissue.
The mechanism involves several signaling molecules and the corresponding recep-
tors on the MSCs cell surface. Some of these signaling molecules have been
identified: chemokines, adhesion molecules, and matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) (Ries et al. 2007 ; Sohni and Verfaillie 2013 ). MSCs are known to express
C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
which are involved in MSC migration (Neuss et al. 2004 ; Shi et al. 2007 ). Notably,
homing-related molecules can be upregulated by inflammatory cytokines such as
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukins, such as IL-1 (Ren et al. 2010 ). Thus,
this means that different inflammation statuses in different patients might lead to
different MSCs engraftments and efficiency (Wei et al. 2013 ). If MSCs are


280 N. Romero-García et al.

intravenously administered, they must adhere to the vascular endothelial wall and
cross the endothelial and muscular layers (Schmidt et al. 2006 ). This transendothelial
migration of MSCs is a three-step process: adhesion, rolling, and crossing endothe-
lial cells, which seems to be mediated by the very late antigen-4/vascular cell
adhesion molecule-1 (VLA-4/VCAM-1) (Ruster et al. 2006 ).
Notably, tracking studies on stem cell delivery in mice have been performed
using gene reporters and noninvasive techniques (PET, bioluminescence, orfluo-
rescence). The reported data suggests that MSCs successfully reach different organs
depending on the previously induced pathology (Belmar-Lopez et al. 2022 ).

Stem Cell-Based Therapies: Clinical Trials

Accumulating evidence supports the increasing use of stem cells in clinical trials,
suggesting their translation from the laboratory bench to the patient’s bedside.
According to theclinicaltrials.govdatabase, as of today (April 28th, 2022), there
are over 9000 studies employing stem cells for regenerative medicine. Figure11.3
highlights the use of MSCs for a wide diversity of pathological conditions.
Another important parameter to describe the use of stem cells in clinical trials is
the phase of the investigation. As shown in Fig.11.4, most studies are on phase
2, which consists of the analysis of the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.
However, this phase is the most limiting since less than 25% of the studies progress
to phase 3, and less than 10% reach phase 4, which are FDA approved drugs. Thus,

Fig. 11.3 Clinical trials using stem cells classified by disease condition


11 Extracellular Vesicles and Cellular Ageing 281

Fig. 11.4 Clinical trials using stem cells classified by the phase of the investigation

thisfigure reflects that the therapeutic effectiveness of stem cell therapies needs to be
carefully addressed and should also focus on long-term effects, which have been
poorly addressed.

Cardiovascular Diseases

Several MSC-based clinical trials have addressed cardiovascular diseases, ischemic
heart diseases, and congestive heart failure. Myocardial infarction causes a loss of
cardiomyocytes, and these dead cardiac cells will become replaced byfibroblasts to
form scar tissue, leading to contractile dysfunction. MSC-based therapy aims at
regenerating the damaged myocardium (Mathiasen et al. 2009 ).
In the study performed by Chen et al. ( 2004 ), myocardial infarction patients were
divided into two groups. One group received an intracoronary injection of bone
marrow (BM)-MSCs whereas the other group received saline. Six months after the
beginning of the treatment, the group that received BM-MSCs displayed increased
movement over the infarcted area, and left ventricular ejection was also improved in
comparison with the control group.
The study of Katritsis et al. ( 2005 ) enrolled patients who had suffered an
anteroseptal myocardial infarction, either recently or a long time ago. All patients
had previously been subjected to angioplasty and stent implantation in the left
anterior descending artery. BM-MSCs were administered through the balloon of
the catheter. They observed improved end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter and
volume, fraction shortening, and ejection fraction. However, these positive effects
were only observable in patients who recently suffered a myocardial infarction.
Mathiasen and colleagues conducted a phase II trial assessing the intramyocardial
delivery of autologous MSCs in patients with chronic ischemic heart failure. A total
of 15 injections were administered to the ischemic region of the myocardium. After
12 months, the damaged myocardial tissue was regenerated improving the functional


282 N. Romero-García et al.

capacity of the injured hearts (Mathiasen et al. 2012 )(ClinicalTrials.gov:
NCT00644410).
Similar results were obtained by Friis et al., where the authors evaluated the
effectiveness of the intramyocardial injection of autologous MSCs in patients suf-
fering from stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and refractory angina. The patients
that received the cell-based therapy displayed enhanced left ventricular function and
exercise capacity (Friis et al. 2011 )(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00260338).

Neurological Disorders

Most MSC-based clinical trials involving the treatment of neurological diseases
targeted Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), multiple sclerosis
(MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and spinal cord injury (SCI).
Previous experimentation has reported that transplanting MSC into the brain is
followed by the re-establishment of neural capacity (improved dopaminergic activ-
ity) through the mechanism of differentiation (Lindvall et al. 2012 ). Similarly,
studies performed in humans have shown that transplanted intracerebral stem cells
acquire local astroglial morphology and enhance the activity of local dopaminergic
neurons (Niclis et al. 2017 ). Moreover, there is an ongoing clinical trial project
named TRANSEURO investigating the benefits of grafting allogeneic dopaminergic
neuroblasts derived from fetal ventral mesencephalic tissue into PD patients to
recuperate the impaired activity dopaminergic neurons (Barker and Consortium
2019 ).
The study performed by Bachoud-Levi et al. analyzed the use of intrastriatal
grafts of human fetal striatal cells. Their results reported improved daily cognitive
and motor functions in three offive total patients as demonstrated by increased
metabolic activity at the graft site (Bachoud-Levi et al. 2000 ). However, another
study showed that a decade after thefirst transplantation in HD patients, the grafts
yielded no survival in the caudate region (Cicchetti et al. 2009 ).
Karussis and colleagues studied the long-term effect of autologous BM-MSC in
patients with intractable MS or progressive ALS. BM-MSCs were injected either
intrathecally or intravenously, and none of them revealed any side effects in the 6– 25
months of follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging displayed the dissemination of
BM-MSCs from the injection site to the meninges and spinal cord parenchyma.
Thus, this data suggested safety and clinical stabilization and even improvement in
some patients (Karussis et al. 2006 ).
Mendonça et al. conducted a phase I trial involving patients with chronic trau-
matic SCI. BM-MSCs were locally injected at the injury site. The treatment was safe
and feasible and all patients displayed improvements in tactile sensitivity and gained
lower limb motor function (Mendonca et al. 2014 )(ClinicalTrials.gov:
NCT01325103).
Taken together, stem cell therapy seems to have a potential neuroprotective
effect. However, neurological disorders are often related to an advanced age. Ageing


11 Extracellular Vesicles and Cellular Ageing 283

could diminish their therapeutic effects on these diseases, potentially leading to graft
failure and other risks (Nguyen et al. 2019 ).

Bone and Cartilage Diseases

The ability of MSCs to differentiate into osteocytes and chondrocytes both in vitro
and in vivo makes them suitable candidates for the treatment of bone and cartilage
diseases, such as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and osteoarthritis (OA) (Liu et al.
2014 ).
Horwitz et al. ( 2002 ) demonstrated the feasibility of combined allogenic
BM-MSC transplantation for children with severe OI. The authors showed that
injected BM-MSCs in bone marrow could migrate to the bone, and differentiate
into osteoblasts to improve bone structure. The clinical trial performed by Le Blanc
et al. ( 2005 ) assessed in utero MSC allogenic transplantation in a female fetus with
severe OI. After birth, the infant showed no immunoreactivity against the donor and
only three fractures appeared in thefirst two years of age with normal psychomotor
development and correct growth tendencies.
Orozco et al. administered autologous BM-MSCs through intra-articular injection
in patients with chronic knee pain and radiological evidence of OA. One year after
the beginning of the treatment, patients showed a rapid and progressive improve-
ment of functional movement, along with a decrease in poor cartilage area and an
enhancement in cartilage quality (Orozco et al. 2013 )(ClinicalTrials.gov:
NCT01183728). Similar results were obtained by Wong et al. ( 2013 ) in patients
undergoing high tibial osteotomy and microfractures in knees with various cartilage
defects. Their results showed improvement in repaired cartilage tissue after two
years of postoperative outcomes.
Despite these optimistic results, the clinical application of MSCs in OA and OI
remains in its infancy, and its effects need to be further addressed.

Other Pathologies

Several new clinical observations reported the efficacy of infused MSC in amelio-
rating tissue damage and/or improving function after injury to other organs, such as
lungs, kidneys, liver, and eyes.
The study performed by Weiss et al. ( 2021 ) evaluated the time course of lung
function, exercise performance, and exacerbation frequency following four monthly
infusions of allogeneic BM-MSCs versus placebo. Their results reported that COPD
patients treated with allogeneic BM-MSCs demonstrated significant improvements
from baseline in forced expiratory volume in one second, forced vital capacity, and
six-minute walk distance at 120 days after thefirst infusion. These improvements
persisted variably over the 2-year observational period (ClinicalTrials.gov:
NCT00683722).


284 N. Romero-García et al.

A randomized study enrolled patients with liver cirrhosis, divided into a control
group (receiving conventional treatment) and an umbilical cord-MSC (UC-MSC)-
treated group (receiving three injections in 4-week intervals). The reported results
showed an increased overall survival rate in the UC-MSC-treated group than in the
control group. Moreover, UC-MSC treatment improved liver function, as demon-
strated by the levels of serum albumin, prothrombin activity, cholinesterase, and
total bilirubin (Shi et al. 2021 )(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01220492).
A study analyzed patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to different
etiologies such as hypertension, or nephrotic syndrome. These patients received an
intravenous infusion of autologous cultured MSCs. Follow-up visits of all patients
did not reveal any cell-related adverse events. However, changes in glomerular
filtration rate and serum creatinine were not statistically significant. This study
showed the safety and tolerability of a single-dose infusion of autologous MSCs in
patients with CKD but without beneficial results (Makhlough et al. 2018 )
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02195323).
A phase I clinical trial enrolled 14 participants who were treated with a single-
dose intravitreal BM-MSC injection. During the 12-month follow-up period, they
found significant improvements in the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) com-
pared to the control group, although they returned to the baseline at 12 months. The
visualfield (VF) and central subfield thickness (CST) remain unaltered, indicating
no remarkable disease progression. Importantly, the authors noticed mild and tran-
sient adverse events after one year of the beginning of the treatment and observed
one severe but manageable adverse effect in one patient in year 3 (Tuekprakhon et al.
2021 )(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01531348).
Taken together, MSC-based therapies seem to have beneficial effects, but long-
term side effects have also been reported.

###### Paracrine Effect of Stem Cells

A paradigm shift emerged suggesting that the beneficial effects of stem cells might
not be restricted to cell replenishment alone, but also to their paracrine effect
(Baraniak and McDevitt 2010 ).
The paracrine effect exerted by MSCs was hypothesized to support the observa-
tion that the number of implanted MSCs detected in target tissue was too low to
explain tissue recovery or wound healing (Wang et al. 2011 ).
Stem cells secrete different kinds of factors that modulate the molecular compo-
sition of the environment to modulate responses from the resident cells’dynamics
(Galderisi and Giordano 2014 ). Stem cells actively contribute to their environment
by secreting cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules
that act either on themselves (autocrine actions) or on neighboring cells (paracrine
actions).


11 Extracellular Vesicles and Cellular Ageing 285

All these factors promote cell protection, proliferation, and migration. Indeed,
these cells secrete proangiogenic factors, antifibrotic factors, factors responsible for
ECM homeostasis, as well as anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, antioxidant, and
immunosuppressive factors. Some of the identified factors involved in immune
system signaling are interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-
1 (MCP-1), and transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b). Other factors have been
characterized as ECM remodelers, among themfibronectin, periostin, collagen,
decorin, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Also, growth factors have been
described, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), colony-stimulating
factor (CSF), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), basicfibroblast growth factor
(bFGF), and insulin-like growth factors (Baraniak and McDevitt 2010 ; Gnecchi et al.
2008 ; Linero and Chaparro 2014 ; Ratajczak et al. 2012 ; Squillaro et al. 2016 ).
In addition to soluble factors, stem cells also release small vesicles, spherical
membrane fragments shed from the cell surface or secreted from the endosomal
compartment (Ratajczak et al.2006b). These vesicles also have an important role in
improving the function of damaged organs as discussed in the following sections.
Taken together, the characteristics of stem cells, including differentiation,
immunomodulation, homing and paracrine effects, make them suitable for cell-
based therapies (Fig.11.5).

Fig. 11.5Stem cell characteristics and culture conditions for clinical trials. After mesenchymal
stem cell (MSC) obtention, an in vitro culture phase is modulated by the cell culture system, the
oxygen tension used, and the media preconditioning. During the in vitro phase, the main charac-
teristics of MSC (differentiation, immunomodulation, homing, and paracrine effects) can be
checked before their use in clinical trials

###### Extracellular Vesicles as Tools for Intercellular

###### Communication

###### EVs: Definition and Classification

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key effectors of intercellular communication. They
can be defined as particles naturally released from a cell to the extracellular space,
which are bound by a lipid bilayer and lacks a functional nucleus, hence cannot
replicate (Théry et al. 2018 ). EVs serve as vehicles for intercellular transfer of
cytosolic proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, allowing for higher biostability and
targeting capacity than other non-capsulated secretome components (Zaborowski
et al. 2015 ). Although they are of utmost importance to maintain homeostasis in
multicellular organisms, unicellular organisms such as bacteria are also capable of
secreting EVs, namedouter membrane vesicles(Yanez-Mo et al. 2015 ).
Traditionally, EVs have been classified according to their biogenetic pathway
(Raposo and Stoorvogel 2013 ). Due to the difficulty in confirming their origin, a
designation based on physical characteristics, such as size, is currently preferred.
EVs size can range from 10 to 20 nm in diameter, although most research focuses on
EVs of 100 nm and above (Margolis and Sadovsky 2019 ). According to the
International Society for Intercellular Vesicles, EVs under 200 nm in diameter
should be considered small EVs, while those over 200 nm are medium or large
EVs. Alternative classifications may be based on properties such as density, bio-
chemical composition or type, and culture condition of the cells of origin (Théry
et al. 2018 ).

###### A Brief History of EVs

Thefirst observations of EVs were reported by Chargaff and West ( 1946 ), who
described them as procoagulant platelet-derived particles that were sedimented after
plasma centrifugation. They were referred to as“platelet dust”in 1967 by Peter
Wolf, who published thefirst electron microscopy images of these particles (Wolf
1967 ). Crawford termed those“microparticles”and showed that their cargo included
lipids, RNA, and contractile proteins (Crawford 1971 ). Throughout the decade, EVs
were isolated from a variety of sources, ranging from human tumor cell cultures to
other bodyfluids (Yanez-Mo et al. 2015 ). In the early 1980s, parallel works from
Johnstone and Stahl named these particles“exosomes”and proposed they served as
a major route for the externalization of damaged proteins (Johnstone et al. 1991 ). A
decade later, Raposo et al. ( 1996 ) found that these exosomes, which they isolated
from Epstein Barr virus-infected B cells, were able to present antigens and induce a
T-cell response. Their work suggested that exosomes’biological functions may go
far beyond cellular waste disposal (Couch et al. 2021 ). This hypothesis was con-
firmed in 2006 by Ratzjack et al., who evidenced that EVs mediate horizontal RNA


11 Extracellular Vesicles and Cellular Ageing 287

transfer capable of reprogramming gene expression of recipient cells (Ratajczak
et al.2006a). Ever since EVs have acquired renewed interest as vehicles of cell-to-
cell communication.

###### EVs Biogenesis

There are currently three known EV biogenetic pathways, giving rise to
(i) exosomes, (ii) microvesicles, and (iii) apoptotic bodies (Fig.11.6). Exosomes,
which range between 40 and 120 nm in diameter, are produced by endocytic budding
of the cell membrane and the formation of an intra-luminal vesicle (ILV) inside the
cell. The ILV is loaded with a particular cargo in an endosomal complex required for
transport (ECRT)-dependent or independent pathway and matures to form a
multivesicular body (MVB). The MVB is transferred alongside microtubules to
fuse with the plasma membrane and exosomes are secreted into the extracellular
space. Microvesicles, also called ectosomes, measure between 100 nm and 1μm and
are formed by outward budding andfission of the plasma membrane. Apoptotic

Fig. 11.6Extracellular vesicles biogenesis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mainly include exosomes,
microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. Exosomes are derived from multivesicular bodies (MVB)
inside the cells that fuse with the plasma membrane. Microvesicles are formed by outward budding
andfission of the plasma membrane. Apoptotic bodies are released by blebbing of cells undergoing
apoptosis. Recipient cells can incorporate EV cargo through endocytosis or phagocytosis. Created

bodies, from 50 nm to 2μm in diameter, are released by blebbing of cells undergoing
apoptosis (Doyle and Wang 2019 ; Yanez-Mo et al. 2015 ; Zaborowski et al. 2015 ).

###### EV Composition

EVs’cargo can include proteins, lipids, genetic materials, and small-molecules
metabolites (amino acids, ATP, amides, sugars, cytokines, etc.) (Hade et al. 2021 ).
EV biogenesis can be used to understand their proteome (Doyle and Wang 2019 ).
EVs’formation and transportation are regulated by ESCRT proteins, thus, these
proteins and their accessory proteins (Alix, TSG101, HSC70, and HSP90) are
expected to be found in EVs (Morita et al. 2007 ). A wide range of proteins have
been confirmed to be integrated into or attached to the membranes of EVs, or are
present in their intra-luminal space. CD63, CD9, and CD81 are transmembrane
proteins of the tetraspanin family and are commonly found in EV membranes (van
der Koog et al. 2022 ). On the other hand, heat shock proteins (Hsp70 and Hsp90),
lysosomal-associated membrane proteins (Lamp2a and Lamp2b), cytoskeletal pro-
teins (actin, tubulin, and cofilin), integrins, and proteoglycans are found within EVs
(Elsharkasy et al. 2020 ). Also, functional proteins might be characteristic of EVs
isolated from specific cell sources. For instance, EVs derived from antigen-
presenting cells (APCs), such as B-lymphocytes, dendritic cells, microglia, and
macrophages, are enriched with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins
(Raposo et al. 1996 ).
EVs have a lipid bilayer and lipidomic analyses have shown that EVs contain
lipid species that are present in the plasma membrane, although EVs are enriched in
glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelins, phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylcholines,
and cholesterol compared to the cellular plasmatic membrane (van der Koog et al.
2022 ). EVs are rounded vesicles, thus the lipid bilayer has a highly curved structure.
This is reflected in the presence of lipid species that allow the curvature in the outer
membrane, such as lipids with one fatty acid chain (Haraszti et al. 2016 ). EVs mainly
contain monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and saturated fatty
acids, though the lipid composition depends on the parent cell (Skotland et al. 2019 ,
2020 ). Interestingly, EVs can transport several bioactive lipids and lipid metabolism-
related enzymes, such as arachidonic acid, leukotrienes prostaglandins, phosphatidic
acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and lysophosphatidylcholine (Subra et al. 2007 ).
The genetic cargo of EVs includes both DNA and RNA. RNAs have been
extensively studied and several analyses have reported that EVs include various
biotypes that represent a selected portion of the RNA content of the parent cell
(O'Brien et al. 2020 ). Among them, small and long noncoding RNAs, including
small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs, ribosomal RNAs, PIWI-interacting
RNAs, transfer RNAs, mitochondrial RNAs, Y RNAs, and vault RNAs
(Chakrabortty et al. 2015 ; Lener et al. 2015 ; Xiang et al. 2013 ). Also, mRNA,
small interfering RNAs, microRNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, guide RNAs,


11 Extracellular Vesicles and Cellular Ageing 289

self-amplifying RNAs, and circular RNAs have been described (Fanale et al. 2018 ;
Geng et al. 2020 ; Li et al. 2014 ).
The RNA within EVs reflects the type and the physiological/pathological state of
the parent cell. However, EVs’RNA content differs from the cellular RNA content,
in terms of both RNA types and their relative concentrations, thus suggesting that
some RNA species are selectively incorporated into extracellular vesicles (Baglio
et al. 2015 ; Guduric-Fuchs et al. 2012 ; Mittelbrunn et al. 2011 ).

###### EV Internalization and Function

EVs can enter a recipient cell through many routes, including macropinocytosis,
lipid-raft-mediated uptake, phagocytosis, and membrane fusion (Mathieu et al. 2019 ;
Mulcahy et al. 2014 ), as well as tunneling nanotubes mediating transfer (Rustom
et al. 2004 ). The main route of EV uptake is likely via clathrin/caveolin-mediated
endocytosis (Mulcahy et al. 2014 ).
It is generally accepted that functional effects on recipient cells, besides direct
signaling from the plasma membrane, might require EV internalization followed by
cargo release into the recipient cell. Overall, so far little is known about the
intracellular processing of EVs’cargo and how delivered instructions are interpreted
by the recipient cell (van Niel et al. 2022 ).
Indeed, the evidence supports the conclusion that uptake does not equate to
functionality. When assessing the functional delivery of cargo, it became evident
that some cargo was retained in the endosomal compartment. The authors showed
that some of the EVs content remained within the cell in a“non-functional”manner.
Almost 17% of the internalized signal was retained in the recipient cell for 24 h after
removing the external source of the signal (O'Brien et al. 2022 ). Similarly, other
studies suggest that EVs, or at least the dyes or labels that are used to visualize them,
eventually end up in lysosomes. These results suggest a possible mechanism of
retaining cargo in endosomes of the recipient cell before degradation or possible
re-release.
At the same time, there is overwhelming evidence that EVs transfer their cargo
into the cytosol of recipient cells and induce epigenetic modifications, which indi-
cates that EVs are capable of avoiding the endolysosomal pathway. It is still
unknown whether the fate of EVs internalized cargo depends on intrinsic differences
between EV subtypes or the fate is dictated by the characteristics of the recipient cell
(van Niel et al. 2022 ).
Most therapeutic uses for EVs require the uptake of encapsulated content into the
cytoplasm (Gurunathan et al. 2019 ). Although the functional delivery of EV content
is often the desired outcome, it should be taken into account that endosomal uptake
often results in lysosomal degradation with the purpose of recycling or eliminating
molecules from the recipient cell (Tian et al. 2010 ).

###### Isolation Methods

EVs can be isolated from the supernatant of cultured cells and biologicalfluids.
There are a plethora of different methods to isolate EVs, however, these have proven
to produce different EV populations and purities. Moreover, some isolation and
purification methods undergo cellular stress that affects EV function (Mas-Bargues
and Borrás 2021).
EVs can be isolated based on their density, size, immunoaffinity, and solubility or
aggregation properties. The most used method is based on the particles’density to
separate them by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 1–2 h (Crescitelli et al. 2013 ;
Gudbergsson et al. 2016 ). Several protocols isolate EVs according to their size, such
as ultrafiltration and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Varderidou-Minasian
and Lorenowicz 2020 ; Xu et al. 2016 ). Both of them are a time and cost-effective
alternative to the gold standard ultracentrifugation. Immunoaffinity-based tech-
niques rely on the use of an antibody (such as tetraspanins CD9, CD63, or CD81)
to interact with the molecules on the EVs’outer surface. These antibodies are
attached to well plates, chromatography columns, magnetic beads, or microfluidic
platforms, thereby allowing EV isolation (Doyle and Wang 2019 ; Li et al. 2017 ;
Sidhom et al. 2020 ). Polymer-induced precipitation is another used method for EV
isolation based on solubility or aggregation properties. Highly hydrophilic polymers
(such as polyethylene glycol (PEG)) interact with water molecules surrounding the
EVs to create a hydrophobic microenvironment, resulting in EV precipitation (Weng
et al. 2016 ). This technique is inexpensive and allows an EV recovery of 90% and a
high yield, but entails sample contamination with protein aggregates and nucleic
acids.

###### Extracellular Vesicles in Regenerative Medicine

###### Regenerative Medicine: From a Cell-Based to a Cell-free

###### Approach

Although stem cell-based regenerative medicine has yielded encouraging results, we
are currently witnessing a transition to a cell-free approach, and notably to an
EV-based approach (Gomzikova and Rizvanov 2017 ; Moghadasi et al. 2021 ). The
reason for this is twofold: EVs might mirror most of the beneficial effects of cell
therapy while facing considerably fewer safety concerns.
On the one hand, it has recently been questioned whether the benefits of cell
therapy are explained by their structural role; that is, by the capacity of stem cells
(SCs) to engraft in damaged tissues and repair them through differentiation. Con-
trarily, the paracrine hypothesis postulates that these regenerative effects might also,
and perhaps more importantly, be attributed to the factors that SCs secrete to the
microenvironment, including EVs. This last idea has received extensive support to


11 Extracellular Vesicles and Cellular Ageing 291

date. First, some studies found that injected SCs have a limited engrafting capacity
in vivo, which is aggravated by their short half-life. Indeed, when injected intrave-
nously, most of them are trapped and damaged in the narrow lung capillaries
(Eggenhofer et al. 2012 ; Kurtz 2008 ). Second, the beneficial effects of SC trans-
plantation have been shown to extend to tissues where SCs do not settle, as was
shown by hematopoietic SC transplantation in renal damage (Duffield et al. 2005 )
and myocardial infarction (Jackson et al. 2001 ; Takahashi et al. 2006 ), or muscular
SCs on a murine progeria model (Lavasani et al. 2012 ). As shown by this last study,
young healthy SCs are capable of rescuing proliferation defects in aged SCs; this
suggests that tissue repair processes could be carried out by the recipient’s SCs after
reactivation by donor SCs, in line with the paracrine hypothesis (Lavasani et al.
2012 ).
On the other hand, EV-based therapies offer remarkable benefits over cell-based
therapies (Prockop et al. 2010 ). The most relevant risks of cell-based approaches are
oncogenic transformation potential and undesired differentiation (Breitbach et al.
2007 ; Miura et al. 2006 ; Røsland et al. 2009 ), which do not occur with EVs since
they lack a functional nucleus. Other safety issues include emboli formation with
intravascular delivery (Furlani et al. 2009 ), pulmonaryfirst-pass effect, and immune
rejection (Moghadasi et al. 2021 ). Being nano-sized, biocompatible, and barely
immunogenic, EVs overcome these drawbacks. Finally, their stability to freezing
cycles, as well as their targeting capability and organotropism, make EVs an
excellent candidate for both, cells and non-capsulated secretome components
(Moghadasi et al. 2021 ).

###### EVs in Regenerative Medicine: Sources and Delivery Routes

Several sources have been described for EVs’isolation in regenerative medicine,
both natural and artificial. Natural sources include SCs and plasma from young
individuals or even centenarians (Yin et al. 2021 ). Among all types of SCs, mesen-
chymal SCs (MSCs) are the most used due to their many advantages, such as their
presence in a wide range of tissues, their effective isolation methods, and their
capacity to grow in adherent cultures. EVs are frequently obtained from bone
marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs), adipose-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs), dental pulp
MSCs (DP-MSCs), and umbilical cord MSCs (uc-MSCs), among others (Álvarez-
Viejo 2020 ). Artificial sources include induced pluripotent SCs (iPSCs), as well as
EVs from natural SCs subject to media preconditioning and coated EVs (Yin et al.
2021 ). While media preconditioning can alter EVs’content, coating only affects
their surface, thus improving EVs’features such as skin absorption (Zhang et al.
2020 ). Regarding delivery routes, EVs are commonly delivered through direct
intravenous or intraperitoneal injection, although the topical application is also
being tested. Alternative routes are hydrogel injection, which allows for slower
absorption, or coating of bioactive scaffolds made of electrospunfibers (de Jong
et al. 2014 ).

###### Role of EVs in the Ageing Process

As fundamental vehicles of intercellular communication, EVs are a double-edged
sword throughout the ageing process. EVs from young organisms, healthy tissues,
and SCs may work as beneficial signaling molecules and stimulate cellular repair.
On the contrary, EVs from old or injured tissues, such as SASP-related EVs, could
spread cell senescence and promote chronic inflammation. In vivo, the circulating
EV pool is likely to represent a continuum from“healthy”to“unhealthy”EVs,
reflecting the status of the different microenvironments. Over time, the balance could
tip in favor of ageing promoting EVs, which positively reinforce organ damage and
lead to age-related diseases in the long term (Lananna and Imai 2021 ). Hence, two
possible gerotherapeutic strategies emerge. First, target cells that secrete“unhealthy”
EVs; this is the endpoint of senolytic and senomorphic drugs (Childs et al. 2017 ).
Second, to replace those with“healthy”EVs, as is the purpose of EV-based
regenerative medicine. The latter strategy is the subject of this chapter.

###### EVs as Gerotherapeutics: Lifespan and Healthspan

Several studies have sought to understand the role of circulating EVs in lifespan and
healthspan in mammals, and whether they could be extended through an EV-based
approach. Thefirst evidence was provided by Zhang et al., who proved that ageing
speed is largely controlled by the hypothalamus through EV-contained miRNAs
(Zhang et al.2017b). In their work, they showed that hypothalamic neural SCs
(NSCs) were lost with age in a murine model, and implantation of young NSCs
extended mice longevity. Interestingly, treatment with NSC-EVs achieved similar
improvements in healthspan, measured through motor coordination, endurance,
sociality, and memory tests. Subsequent studies have supported this hypothesis,
achieving a healthspan extension by reducing hypothalamic NSCs senescence (Xiao
et al. 2020 ).
Recently, Yoshida et al. identified another EV component involved in
ageing and longevity regulation in mammals: extracellular nicotinamide
phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD+) biosynthetic enzyme (Yoshida et al. 2019 ). It has been established that
NAD+bioavailability declines with age, causing a variety of age-related changes
(Verdin 2015 ). Some studies show that eNAMPT secreted by adipose tissue—
enhanced by certain stimuli, like fasting, through a SIRT1-mediated pathway—
reaches the hypothalamus and locally increases NAD+, improving physical perfor-
mance in mice (Yoon et al. 2015 ). Recent works prove that EV-contained eNAMPT
decreases over time, therefore treatment with eNAMPT-containing EVs isolated
from plasma of young mice can increase the lifespan and healthspan of old mice
(Yoshida et al. 2019 ).

###### EVs as Gerotherapeutics: Hallmarks of Ageing

Many studies have questioned whether EVs from different sources can ameliorate
different hallmarks of ageing, with promising results. Of all the hallmarks, the most
frequently studied concerning EVs is cellular senescence. Recent work from Fafián-
Labora et al. found that small EVs from youngfibroblasts could ameliorate
senescence-related biomarkers infibroblasts from old or Hutchinson-Gilford proge-
ria syndrome donors, as well as mice. They propose glutathione-S-transferase mu
2 (GSTM2), an antioxidant EV-contained enzyme whose activity declines with age,
is responsible for the observed changes, in line with the decreased reactive oxygen
species (ROS) levels and lipid peroxidation after treatment (Fafián-Labora et al.
2020 ). Another work with an iPSC-EVs treatment on senescent MSCs was able to
decrease senescent phenotype by delivery of different antioxidant enzymes,
peroxiredoxins 1 and 2 (Liu et al. 2019 ). Further studies in UVB-radiatedfibroblasts
support the senotherapeutic potential of EVs, although the underlying mechanism
has not been elucidated yet (Deng et al. 2020 ; Oh et al.2018). Recently, Dorronsoro
et al., injected old mice intraperitoneally with MSC-EVs from young mice and
measured senescence markers in different organs. They observed a decrease in
most markers, including senescence-associated ß-galactosidase, p16, p21, and
pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1ß and IL-6. Consequently, they proposed
MSC-EVs might work as senomorphics; that is, they might downregulate the
expression of SASP-related factors, hence impairing the spread of this senescent
state to adjacent cells (Dorronsoro et al. 2021 ).
Regarding other hallmarks, evidence is less abundant but still optimistic.
MSC-EVs may be able to attenuate stem cell exhaustion, as shown by in vitro
studies on BM-MSC-EVs and DP-MSC-EVs (Dorronsoro et al. 2021 ; Mas-Bargues
et al. 2020 ). In this last study, treated cells recovered their stemness as evidenced by
pluripotency factor (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC) overexpression and the shift
toward a highly glycolytic and low oxidative metabolism (Mas-Bargues et al.
2020 ). In some recent studies, treatment with EVs from young serum and MSCs
has increased the expression of telomere-related genes, which could attenuate
telomere shortening (Lee et al. 2018 ; Sonoda et al. 2020 ). Thefirst study also
found that mTOR and IGF-1 levels were generally lower after treatment, therefore,
they might play a role in alleviating deregulated nutrient sensing (Lee et al. 2018 ).
Furthermore, research on cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases shows that
the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs point to an increase in autophagy as the
underlying mechanism; for this reason, it has been suggested that MSC-EVs may
also help preserve proteostasis (Chen et al. 2020 ; He et al. 2020 ; Liu et al. 2017 ).

###### EVs and Age-related Diseases

Nowadays, more than 20% of the total burden of disease is due to people aged
60 years and over, with special emphasis on cardiovascular disease (30%), cancer


294 N. Romero-García et al.

Fig. 11.7 Extracellular vesicles in ageing and age-related diseases. EVs can be isolated from
plasma or MSC obtained from dental pulp, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, or bone marrow. EVs can
modulate ageing and age-related diseases. Regarding the former, EVs’content (miRNAs and
extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT)) could be involved in longevity
regulation, and EVs from young donors could ameliorate some hallmarks of ageing such as cellular
senescence and stem cell exhaustion. Regarding the latter, EVs-based therapies are being used for
cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neurodegenerative, and metabolic diseases. Created with
BioRender.com

(15%), and pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and neurodegenerative diseases (Prince
et al. 2015 ). Given the promising results of EVs-based therapy to slow or even
reverse some hallmarks of physiological ageing, it is not surprising that they are
currently under study as next-generation therapies for age-related diseases
(Fig.11.7).

Cardiovascular Diseases

The cardioprotective properties of MSC-EVs have been investigated in a variety of
age-related diseases, such as myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, and
atherosclerosis. Recovery of cardiac function after MI has been in the spotlight
since the origins of stem cell therapy (Jackson et al. 2001 ), and this interest has
continued to rise with cell-free approaches, given its long-term morbidity as a cause
of heart failure. Several studies have shown that MSC-EVs notably contribute to
myocardial repair after MI, reducing infarct size and ultimately improving functional
parameters such as stroke volume and cardiac output (Bian et al. 2014 ; Teng et al.
2015 ). Not only MSCs but different cell types, such as cardiomyocyte progenitor
cells, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and iPSCs have been used for EV isolation
with similar results (Rezaie et al. 2019 ). Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of
these effects remains elusive. Since one of the main processes driving the recovery of


11 Extracellular Vesicles and Cellular Ageing 295

ischemic myocardium is angiogenesis, it has been proposed that MSC-EVs could
induce capillary development through the delivery of miR-210 (Bian et al. 2014 ;
Teng et al. 2015 ; Wang et al.2017a). Another mechanism under study is the
modulation of the pro-inflammatory microenvironment (Teng et al. 2015 ), which
could be achieved by activating the S1P/SK1/S1PR1 pathway and M2 macrophage
polarization, in close relation to EV-contained miR-182 (Deng et al. 2019 ). Lastly,
MSC-EVs could prevent myocardiocyte apoptosis and cardiacfibrosis through
miR-221, which downregulates PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis).
Ex vivo assays, where cardiac stem cells were pretreated with MSC-EVs, have also
shown promising results (Zhang et al. 2016 ). Regarding ischemic stroke, evidence
suggests that both neural plasticity and revascularization promoted by MSC-EVs
may accelerate functional recovery in animal models (Xin et al.2013a, b).
Since atherosclerosis is the disease underlying the aforementioned events, it has
become an emerging therapeutic target. MSC-EVs’contribution to the stabilization
of atherosclerotic plaques is two-sided. First, they can inhibit endothelial cell
(EC) apoptosis and promote proliferation by activating Nrf2, which protects ECs
against oxidative stress (Chen et al. 2021 ). Secondly, the let-7c miRNA family
carried by EVs downregulates the NF-κBinflammation pathway. This anti-
inflammatory effect is enhanced through the shifting of macrophage phenotype
from M1 to M2 (Li et al. 2019 ; Ma et al. 2021 ).

Neurodegenerative Diseases

In the central nervous system (CNS), EVs are studied with particular interest because
they solve a difficulty of conventional drugs: the crossing of the blood–brain barrier
(BBB). Being small-sized and highly lipophilic, they reach deep into the CNS,
where they exert regenerative and immunomodulatory effects (Guy and Offen
2020 ). Recent studies on Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) mice models show that
MSC-EVs improved cognition and alleviated memory deficits, which was consistent
with the observed decrease in Amyloid-β(Aβ) plaques in the brain. MSC-EVs
decreased astrocyte and microglia activation by tipping the balance from
pro-inflammatory IL-1 and TNF-a to anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10. This
led to the discovery of miR-21, an EV-contained miRNA capable of downregulating
the STAT3–NF-κB axis responsible for the amplification of neural damage in AD
(Cui et al. 2018 ). Similar results have been obtained with intraventricular injection of
MSCs-EVs, where a marked increase of synaptogenesis in the hippocampus was
attributed to miR-146a (Nakano et al. 2020 ). In another study, neural recovery from
Aβ-induced damage and ROS decrease was achieved by MSC-EVs through the
transfer of enzymatically active catalase (Bodart-Santos et al. 2019 ). Likewise, blood
marrow and umbilical cord MSC-EVs have shown therapeutic effects on
Parkinson’s disease rat models by stimulating neuronal differentiation in the
substantia nigra(Mendes-Pinheiro et al. 2019 ), as well as inducing autophagy and
decreasing apoptosis, thereby upregulating dopamine levels in the striatum and
improving motor function (Chen et al. 2020 ).


296 N. Romero-García et al.

Musculoskeletal Diseases

Current studies have unveiled the potential of MSC-EVs in musculoskeletal disor-
ders, which are responsible for the exponential increase in frailty among the elderly.
Osteoarthritis (OA) stands as the most prevalent disease in this group, several
strategies have been pursued to restore cartilage and bone homeostasis. On the one
side, MSC-EVs from adipose tissue were able to promote chondrocyte survival,
decrease apoptosis, and improve autophagy; these effects were due to EV-contained
miR-100-5p, which downregulates the mTOR pathway (Wu et al. 2019 ). Moreover,
ADSC-EVs effectively tackled senescence features in OA osteoblasts (Tofiño-Vian
et al. 2017 ). On the other side, MSC-EVs promoted repair of extracellular matrix
(ECM) by increasing collagen type II synthesis and downregulating ECM-degrading
enzymes, such as ADAMTS5 and metalloproteinases MMP1 and MMP13 (Cosenza
et al. 2017 ; Jin et al. 2020 ;Wangetal.2017b). The functional translation of these
effects was remarkable, with recovery from gait abnormalities in murine models
(Cosenza et al. 2017 ).
Positive OA osteoblasts results have driven interest in MSC-EVs to another major
disease, osteoporosis. In vitro experiments showed that MSC-EVs obtained from
human iPSC could increase protein expression of osteoblast-related genes and
proliferation rates (Qi et al. 2016 ). In vivo models of osteoporosis in ovariectomized
rats support these osteogenic and angiogenic effects of EVs, administered by two
different routes: direct intraosseous injection or implantation of an EVs-releasing
scaffold (Qi et al. 2016 ). MSC-EVs may as well have regenerative effects on the
intervertebral disc via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (Xia et al. 2019 ),
thus constituting an attractive option for herniated disc prevention.
Sarcopenia is a condition that affects mostly elderly people to a greater or lesser
extent and is particularly aggravated by episodes of illness or hospital admission.
Although little has been published on age-related sarcopenia, there is growing
evidence that MSC-EVs could be of value in preventing drug-induced muscle
wasting (Cho et al. 2021 ; Li et al. 2021 ). A recent study found increased myotube
diameter both in vitro and in vivo after treatment and an increase in muscle weight
and strength, which may be explained by EV-contained miR-486-5p and its inhib-
itory effect on FoxO1 (Li et al. 2021 ). Similar work with tonsil MSC-EVs identified
miR-145-5p as the responsible component for increased myogenic differentiation
and total muscle mass in mice (Cho et al. 2021 ).

Other Diseases

One of the most important causes of morbimortality among the elderly is metabolic
diseases, in particular, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is intimately related
to obesity, non-fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndrome. T2DM is caused by
increased peripheral resistance to insulin action, which drives an increased
hepatic glucose output and, ultimately, impaired insulin secretion. In one study,
uc-MSC-EVs proved useful in promoting hepatic glycogen storage and reducing


11 Extracellular Vesicles and Cellular Ageing 297

gluconeogenesis, via AMPK signaling and autophagy induction, both in hepatocyte
culture and in a T2DM rat model (He et al. 2020 ). Likewise, they reduced glucose
levels and improved insulin sensitivity, promoting the expression of GLUT-4
receptors in muscle (Sun et al. 2018 ). Even though pancreatic damage does not
play a role until the late stages of the disease, results in this regard are also
encouraging and leave the door open for future studies in T1DM (Sun et al. 2018 )
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02138331).
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent disease that greatly compromises
the quality of life in the elderly, because the only available treatments, dialysis, and
renal transplant, are potentially risky and have high costs. MSC-EVs have success-
fully been used to increase renal function parameters, such as glomerularfiltration
rate or urea and creatinine levels, in advanced stages of CKD in a recent clinical trial
(Nassar et al. 2016 ). Interestingly, stimulation of MSCs with melatonin, a proposed
renoprotective hormone, may enhance EVs’regenerative potential in a murine
model of CKD.
Cancer accounts for one of the highest burdens in the elderly (Prince et al. 2015 ).
MSC-EVs have not received so much attention in cancer therapy, given that many of
the biological processes they stimulate, such as cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and
immunosuppression, could favor tumor growth and extension (Xunian and Kalluri
2020 ). Nonetheless, a clinical trials are currently in progress using modified
MSC-EVs as drug carriers for cancer therapy, such as colon cancer (ClinicalTrials.
gov NCT01294072) and pancreatic cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03608631).
In conclusion, preclinical data provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of
MSC-EVs-based therapies against a variety of age-related diseases. A number of
these studies have already reached the stage of clinical trials, as is the case in
ischemic stroke (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03384433), AD (ClinicalTrials.gov:
NCT04388982), OA (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04223622), CKD (Nassar et al.
2016 ), and cancer. While EV studies are an evolvingfield in preclinical ageing
research, some factors still hinder their translation to the clinical setting. Among
them, we could underscore the lack of established cell culture conditions, the
absence of scalable EV isolation protocols, more thorough investigations on the
optimal therapeutic dose, administration routes and schedule, and reliable assays to
evaluate the efficacy of EV-based therapies.

###### Concluding Remarks

Stem cells play a key role in maintaining tissue homeostasis, both after injury and
during ageing. Stem cells have unique characteristics, such as differentiation, hom-
ing, and immunomodulation which make them suitable candidates for regenerative
medicine. Stem cell-based therapies are currently aiming to improve damaged tissue
functionality with promising results. However, long-term issues have been associ-
ated with stem cell therapies, such as poor engraftment at the injury site. This led to
the hypothesis that stem cell-derived effects were due to their ability to modulate the


298 N. Romero-García et al.

microenvironment. Indeed, paracrine effects proved to be as effective as stem cell
transplants. The study of the released molecules evolved into non-cell-based thera-
pies; the golden star being mediated by extracellular vesicles. EVs’content includes
bioactive molecules, such as lipids, proteins, and genetic material that modulate the
fate of the target cell. EVs-based therapy could slow down or even reverse some
hallmarks of physiological ageing. Moreover, EVs are being used in many clinical
trials for several age-related diseases, both as biomarkers and treatments.
Overall, these studies need to be developed, and more research should be
performed to address several questions, such as EVs’in vivo biodistribution and
fate, the different processing of EVs cargo by target cells, or the relative potency of
EVs in directing cell–cell communication compared to other secretome components.
These and many other questions are key questions and challenges that remain to be
addressed.

#### Fibrinogen, Coagulation, and Ageing

Rebecca Donkin, Yoke Lin Fung, and Indu Singh

Abstract The World Health Organization estimates that the world’s population
over 60 years of age will nearly double in the next 30 years. This change imposes
increasing demands on health and social services with increased disease burden in
older people, hereafter defined as people aged 60 years or more. An older population
will have a greater incidence of cardiovascular disease partly due to higher levels of
bloodfibrinogen, increased levels of some coagulation factors, and increased platelet
activity. These factors lead to a hypercoagulable state which can alter haemostasis,
causing an imbalance in appropriate coagulation, which plays a crucial role in the
development of cardiovascular diseases. These changes in haemostasis are not only
affected by age but also by gender and the effects of hormones, or lack thereof in
menopause for older females, ethnicity, other comorbidities, medication interac-
tions, and overall health as we age. Another confounding factor is how we measure
fibrinogen and coagulation through laboratory and point-of-care testing and how our
decision-making on disease and treatment (including anticoagulation) is managed. It
is known throughout life that in normal healthy individuals the levels offibrinogen
and coagulation factors change, however, reference intervals to guide diagnosis and
management are based on only two life stages, paediatric, and adult ranges. There
are no specific diagnostic guidelines based on reference intervals for an older
population. How ageing relates to alterations in haemostasis and the impact of the

###### Introduction

The healthy life expectancy reached 70.9 years and the average life expectancy was
62.5 years for males in 2019, and for females were 75.9 years and 64.9 years,
respectively (Geneva World Health Organization 2021 ). The World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) estimates that the world’s population over 60 years will nearly double
from 12% to 22% between 2015 and 2050 (World Health Organization 2021 ). These
changes are not limited to wealthy countries as by 2050, 80% of older people will be
living in low- and middle-income countries. Australia’s population has also been
ageing faster with people aged 65 years or over doubling over the last half century
(AIHW 2021 ). Thus, these demographic changes impose increasing demands on
health and social services. For example, older adults consume more than 60% of the
transfused blood (Tinegate et al. 2016 ; Simon et al. 2021 ). It has been estimated that
23% of the total global disease burden disorders are in older people aged 60 years or
more (Prince et al. 2015 ). Just under a third of the disease burden in older adults is
due to cardiovascular diseases, followed by malignant neoplasms, chronic respira-
tory diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, and neurological and mental disorders.
Haemostasis imbalance plays a crucial role in the development of cardiovascular
diseases. Haemostasis involves the balance of coagulation andfibrinolysis and is
associated with both arterial and venous thrombotic events. Ageing is associated
with increased levels of some coagulation factors and a decrease in natural antico-
agulant factors leading to a hypercoagulable state in the elderly (Amin et al. 2012 ).
An increment of plasmafibrinogen level by 10 mg/dL (equivalent to 0.1 g/L) for
each decade can be expected in healthy participants (Mari et al.2008a, 2008b). It has
been known for a few decades now through multiple studies that older people tend to
have higher levels of bloodfibrinogen, with concentrations increasing around
0.1–0.2 g/L each decade (Tybjaerg-Hansen et al. 1997 ; Siegbahn and Ruusuvaara
1988 ; Connelly et al. 1992 ).
In addition, it is important to recognise the gender differences in older age. The
social, Environmental, and economic gender differences vary by country with the
proportion of women in the labour force being lower, fewer with full-time contrib-
uting employment, and a lower socio-economic and health and well-being status
(Carmel 2019 ). Along with this, age-related hormonal changes such as menopause
influence the gender differences in haemostatic parameters (Bucciarelli and
Mannucci 2002 ; Lippi et al. 2014 ).


12 Fibrinogen, Coagulation, and Ageing 315

This chapter will review the age-related alterations in haemostasis, the impact of
disease on haemostasis, anticoagulation, and laboratory testing. Throughout this
chapter older adults will refer to anyone aged 60 years or more.

###### Haemostasis

Normal functioning haemostasis reduces the risk of thrombosis and haemorrhage
and is the balanced response to vascular injury to prevent bleeding through
procoagulant pathways and the mechanisms that inhibit clotting away from the
vascular injury. The physiological process of haemostasis in response to vascular
injury begins with local vascular contraction, reduction of bloodflow to the injury
site and platelet plug formation, together this is known as primary haemostasis. The
natural thrombogenic components in the body that tips the balance towards coagu-
lation in primary haemostasis include exposed endothelium, tissue factor, and
collagen from the damaged vessel wall along with circulating platelets. Secondary
haemostasis is the clotting coagulation process that occurs in the plasma and
involves the interaction between clotting factors and inhibitors to form a stable
blood clot from the activation offibrinogen tofibrin through the cascade of events
that include circulating elements such as prothrombin, fibrinogen, and von
Willebrand factor (Palta et al. 2014 ). When the vessel wall integrity has been
repaired the process of removing the clot occurs which is termedfibrinolysis. If
the normal physiological process of preventing bleeding and excessive clotting is not
met patients are at increased risk for either thrombosis or haemorrhage. A schematic
of the physiological coagulation cascade and the factors involved in secondary
haemostasis are outlined in Fig.12.1.

###### Haemostatic Changes with Age

The parameters offibrinogen and coagulation may change as a part of normal ageing
or they may be influenced by several disorders that occur with ageing. Common
comorbidities that occur with ageing may account for the increased risk for both
thrombosis and haemorrhage (Kwaan et al. 2014 ). Predominantly this includes
changes tofibrinogen, FVIII, and von Willebrand Factor, which are all acute
phase reactants and D-dimers and Antithrombin (Favaloro et al. 2014 ). As life
expectancy increases some age-related changes occur with haemostasis that is likely
driven by chronic inflammation. This effect occurs through various organ systems
and pathways with cardiovascular and neurological diseases having the most fre-
quently observed haemostasis alterations (Teer et al. 2019 ).
The ageing process activates leucocytes, specifically lymphocytes and mono-
cytes. These leucocytes produce cytokines that induce inflammatory responses,
increase inflammatory proteins and, in turn, express tissue factors in their

cytoplasmic membranes initiating coagulation (Jabbour et al. 2009 ). Fibrinogen, the
procoagulant protein in haemostatic reactions leads to blood coagulation and can
interfere with plasma viscosity and is one of the most studied proteins in haemostatic
changes throughout life (de Magalhães et al. 2020 ). The increase in coagulation
occurs both during natural ageing and infection, as well as cellular and tissue stress.
Thus, it is considered a biomarker of risk in thrombotic disease.
Older patients with increased markers of thrombin generation (D-dimer and
prothrombin fragment 1 + 2) are at increased risk for cognitive decline and deteri-
oration in their ability to perform activities of daily living. This is likely attributable
to the increased risk of cerebral ischemic damage associated with prothrombotic
states (Stott et al. 2010 ).
Chronic HIV infection shares the states of inflammation and hypercoagulability
that are also seen with age-related changes. Despite control of HIV infection,
patients persist with a subclinical inflammatory state due to changes in the immune
system by latent infections such as cytomegalovirus and microbial translocation
(Paiardini and Müller-Trutwin 2013 ). Chronic infection of HIV promotes changes in
haemostasis and coagulation inconsequence of persistent systemic immune activa-
tion, micro- and macro-vascular diseases, and, potentially, impaired hepatic synthe-
sis of coagulation factors (de Magalhães et al. 2020 ).
Whilst chronic infection can impair the synthesis of coagulation factors in the
liver and lead to bleeding complications, patients with liver disease can also expe-
rience thrombosis (Qamar et al. 2018 ). The risk for both bleeding and thrombosis
stems from alterations in platelet activity, thrombin generation andfibrinolysis
which favour both pro- and anticoagulable states (Wadsworth et al. 2021 ). There-
fore, elderly patients with hepatic impairment are at increased risk of bleeding

complications and thrombotic events. Along with liver complications patients with
chronic kidney disease have an increased risk for thromboembolic and bleeding
events. Multifactorial haemostasis disorders are typical of patients with end-stage
renal disease on chronic haemodialysis (Pluta et al. 2020 ). In 2016, over 300,000
patients with end-stage renal disease in the United States suffered from non-valvular
atrialfibrillation, with a prevalence as high as 20% in patients on haemodialysis
(Saran et al. 2019 ).
The cardiovascular system has the most frequently observed haemostasis alter-
ations associated with increased age. Patients with prosthetic heart valves are at an
increased risk for thrombotic events (Wadsworth et al. 2021 ). Patients with ischemic
or non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy may develop left ventricular thrombus. Valvular
heart disease and atrialfibrillation commonly coexist, and each contributes indepen-
dently to thromboembolic events and mortality (Renda et al. 2017 ). Valvular atrial
fibrillation can occur from a mechanical prosthetic heart valve or moderate to severe
mitral stenosis, conditions that substantially increase thromboembolic risk and are
associated as comorbidities with increased age (Chen et al. 2020 ).
Common comorbidities associated with ageing such as cancer increase the risk of
venous and arterial thromboembolism and bleeding events (Mosarla et al. 2019 ). A
sedentary lifestyle associated with ageing can also increase the risk of a thrombotic
or bleeding event and lifestyle choices that may lead to obesity are a risk factor for
venous thromboembolism, atrialfibrillation, and cardiovascular disease. With the
increasing prevalence of obesity and the accompanying treatment for cardiovascular
risks, anticoagulation in patients with obesity is increasingly a topic of concern
(Wadsworth et al. 2021 ). In particular, drug interactions to treat comorbidities
including human immunodeficiency virus, organ transplantation, infection, malig-
nancy, epilepsy, arrhythmia, renal disease, or hepatic disease, increase the likelihood
of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) drug interactions due to concomitant medica-
tions or pharmacokinetic changes (Chen et al. 2020 ).

###### Platelet Function

Through their aggregation, platelets release constituents from their granules, which
are necessary for thrombus formation. Platelet activation leads to a change in the
expression of surface glycoproteins (GP). During the stimulation and activation
phase of platelets, P-selectin translocates from alpha granules and Weibel-Palade
bodies of endothelial cells to the cell membrane (Stenberg 1985 ). On the platelet
surface membrane, GPIIb-IIIa undergoes an activation-dependent conformational
change which allows it to bind tofibrinogen (Shattil et al. 1985 ). Binding of
thrombospondin to GPIV is elevated, and the von Willebrand factor binding site
on the GPIb-IX complex is downregulated in thrombin-activated platelets (Kestin
1993 ). Recognition of these alterations that occur on the membrane of platelets has
been applied to the analysis of platelet activation by specific antibodies (Gryglewski
1988 ). It is believed that procoagulant mechanisms are not the single reason behind

thromboxane (thromboxane prostanoid)

increased platelet action. Loss of the preventive effect of antiaggregatory actions can
lead to hyperactivity of platelets as well.
Key in vivo activating factors that stimulate platelets are thromboxane A 2 , ADP,
collagen, and thrombin. Adrenaline and serotonin are also weak stimulants of
platelets (Rand et al. 2003 ). There are different receptors for the above-mentioned
agonists and for other mediators such as von Willebrand factor (VWF) andfibrin-
ogen (Rand et al. 2003 ). Some platelet receptors and their corresponding agonists are
shown in Fig.12.2.
Stimulation of platelet aggregation is initiated by the production and release of
TXA2, exocytosis of dense granules secreting ADP, serotonin, and thrombin (Rand
et al. 2003 ). Release of P-selectin fromα-granules is initiated in response to platelet
activation and is expressed on the plasma membrane (Rand et al. 2003 ). Platelet
pro-aggregators perform in an interactive way, so platelet activation is highly
affected when one of the mechanisms of platelet aggregation is impaired (Rand
et al. 2003 ). Platelet activation leads to a change in the level of expressed surface
glycoproteins (GP). These GPs include integrins and non-integrins, which play an
important role in platelet adhesion and aggregation and work as receptors for platelet
agonists (Ashby et al. 1990 ). Upon the stimulation and activation phase of platelets,
P-selectin is translocated from alpha granules in platelets and Weibel-Palade bodies
of endothelial cells to the cell membrane (Stenberg 1985 ). On the platelet surface
membrane, GPIIb-IIIa undergoes an activation-dependent conformational change
which allows it to bind tofibrinogen (Shattil et al. 1985 ). In addition, the binding of
thrombospondin to GPIV is elevated, and the von Willebrand factor binding site on


12 Fibrinogen, Coagulation, and Ageing 319

GPIb-IX complex is downregulated in thrombin-activated platelets (Kestin 1993 ;
Coller et al. 1983 ). Recognition of these alterations that occur on the membrane of
platelets, by special antibodies, is used for accurate analysis of the activation of
platelets in the blood (Gryglewski 1988 ).

###### Anti-aggregators of Platelets

The most important antiaggregant includes prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) and nitric oxide
(NO), which are released by the normal vascular endothelium and regulate the action
of proaggregants to prevent the formation of thrombi in the intact blood vessels
(Gryglewski 1988 ). Unlike antiaggregants and proaggregants, which apply their
actions by attaching to specific receptors on the plasma membrane of platelets, NO
crosses the membrane and stimulates guanylate cyclase, hence inhibiting platelet
activation (Makhoul et al. 2018 ). The released signals from the stimulated receptor
are transferred inside the platelet by a group of signal transduction processes, each
including GTP binding proteins (G-protein) (Ashby et al. 1990 ). G-proteins repre-
sent many groups of variable cellular proteins that take part in different cellular
processes, including regulation of signal transduction pathways (Zachariou et al.
2012 ). The outcome of activation of the proaggregatory signal transduction pro-
cesses is the stimulation of other systems, such as phospholipase C (PLC) activated
hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids and unlocking of ion channels. In contrast, the
activator systems of the antiaggregatory processes initiate adenylate and guanylate
cyclase, hence inhibiting platelet activation (Makhoul et al. 2018 ). Promotion of
these activator systems results in different biological responses due to many changes
in phosphorylation conditions, enzymatic actions, and physical characteristics of the
main proteins of platelet (Gryglewski 1988 ).

###### Platelet–Endothelial–White Blood Cell Immuno-pathological

###### Interactions

Platelet adherence and aggregation on the vascular endothelium can be prevented by
anti-aggregators, such as NO and PGI 2 (Gryglewski 1988 ; Vinik et al. 2001 )as
shown in Fig.12.3.
There are many components, like plasma thrombin and bradykinin, platelet-
released serotonin, platelet-derived growth factor, interleukin-1, and ADP, which
enhance the endothelial production of these anti-aggregators in the presence of
aggregating platelets (Vane et al. 1990 ). Furthermore, the purpose of this inhibitory
effect of NO and PGI2 is to bind the platelet plug to the site of vascular damage.
PGI 2 binds to a specific platelet receptor, which is linked to G-protein to activate
adenylate cyclase. An adenylate cyclase inhibitory G-protein is associated with an
α 2 -adrenergic receptor, that relates to epinephrine (Klaff et al. 1981 ). In addition, NO

disperses through the plasma membrane of the platelet and stimulates guanylate
cyclase (Mitchell et al. 2008 ). Consequently, phosphorylation by cAMP-dependant
and cGMP-dependant protein kinases and consequent suppression of platelet pro-
teins, which are fundamental for the process of aggregation, represents the outcome
of these preventive mechanisms (Gryglewski 1988 ; Lazarowski et al. 1990 ).

###### Platelet Activity and Cardiovascular Disease

Increased platelet activity is an important predictive marker for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) (Christie et al. 2008 ). Thrombotic effects of platelets can be initiated
by vascular wall endothelial damage or injury by atheromatous plaque. The platelets
adhere to damaged endothelium, which in turn, will change their shape and undergo
degranulation and activation. Activation of the platelets leads to the conjugation of
fibrinogen to the platelets through their GP IIb/IIIa receptors (Santhakumar et al.


12 Fibrinogen, Coagulation, and Ageing 321

Fig. 12.4 Platelet function and molecular targets of antiplatelet agents. Gremmel et al. (2016).
(Open access)

2014 ). Many antiplatelet medications have been used to mitigate platelet activation
and aggregation and consequently lower thrombotic and CVD risks (Smith et al.
2019 ).
Antiplatelet therapies interfere with platelet adhesion and aggregation and are
often used as an alternative to or complement anticoagulants. They act by blocking
various platelet receptors. Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
Dypyridamole, and Sulphinpyrazone are the COX1 inhibitors. ADP receptor inhib-
itors include Toclopidine hydrochloride, Clopidogrel bisulphate, and Prasugrel
inhibit platelet ADP P2Y12 receptor. Other common antiplatelet therapy includes
the GP11b-111a receptor agonists such as Tirofiban, Abciximab, and Eptifibatide.
Figure12.4shows the platelet receptors which are blocked by these antiplatelet
drugs.
One of the most commonly used antiplatelet drug is Aspirin which is available
over the counter without a prescription. Older people have been shown to be at risk


322 R. Donkin et al.

of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes and Aspirin is given to these people regularly
for the prevention of a cardiovascular event particularly patients with a history of
CVD. However, there is limited evidence showing that there are certain specific
changes in platelets with ageing.

###### Platelet Changes with Age

Ageing is a complex physiological change that is related to increased oxidative stress
that may change platelet activity thus leading to cardiovascular disorders. Platelet
count shows a well-documented decrease during ageing. The platelet count remains
relatively stable during middle age (25–60 years old) but falls in old age (60–70+).
The effect of age on platelet function is slightly less clear. A progressive increase in
platelet responsiveness to different agonists has been shown during middle age
(25–65 years of age) both in men and women, but data is limited for older people.
Very little evidence exists on the changes in platelet function in old age (i.e. greater
than 75 years old). This is partly because of an assumption that the data from middle-
aged subjects can be extrapolated into older age groups, but mainly because of the
difficulty of studying platelet function in older subjects in whom the onset of chronic
disease and the increased prescription of a range of medications make it hard to
separate the effects of ageing on platelet function from other confounders. The
Framingham Heart Study concluded that platelet aggregability decreases with
increasing age in healthy individuals (O’Donnell et al. 2001 ). They indicated that
the effect of age on platelet function is not linear but, like the effect of age on platelet
count, changes at different stages of ageing. Despite little knowledge and evidence
of age-related platelet activity, there is evidence showing biochemical changes in the
aged population compared to middle age or younger people. Oxidative stress has
also been shown to increase platelets during ageing. This increase results in the
ability of NO to inhibit platelet activation, which may explain some of the pheno-
typic variations seen in platelets during ageing. The changes seen in platelets during
ageing are likely to result from alterations in platelet production and a reaction to the
environmental changes within the blood or vasculature such as age-related changes
in the bone marrow. The level of haematopoietic tissue within the bone marrow and
its cellularity remains relatively stable during middle age but drops in people over
80 years, with a marked increase in apoptotic cells within the bone marrow (Ogawa
et al. 2000 ). This change in haematopoietic tissue probably also impacts platelet
function. The evidence in the literature shows the fall in platelet count starts in
humans over 60 years old, whereas haematopoietic tissue changes occur later. This
discrepancy could be due to different age groups of subjects in various studies. It is
also known that plasma composition and endothelial function change with age which
could be instrumental in having an impact on platelet function.
It has been demonstrated that endothelial dysfunction increases with age, leading
to reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and altered prostaglandin profiles (Qian
et al. 2012 ; Walsh et al. 2009 ; Yavuz et al. 2008 ). NO and PGI2 being potent


12 Fibrinogen, Coagulation, and Ageing 323

inhibitors of platelet function, their gradual decrease may lead, in middle age, to
increased platelet activity. Reduced platelet inhibition also leads to thrombocytope-
nia at the point where deterioration in vascular health prompts a significant number
of platelets to become sufficiently activated to bind to sites of impaired endothelial
function or vascular damage or be removed from the circulation in the liver or
spleen.
There seems to be a combination of multiple age-related changes including
the bone marrow anatomy, megakaryopoiesis, platelet production, and a change in
the environment of platelets in circulation. All these play a part in regulating the
modification of platelets during ageing. However, there is a lack of data to provide
evidence of specific ages when platelet numbers decrease or platelet function
increases. Nonetheless, there are changes related to middle age and old age such
as mRNA and microRNA expression changes, increased oxidative stress, and
modification of platelet receptors. These changes affect both bleeding and thrombo-
sis and particularly impact thrombotic disease therefore, the use of anti-platelet drugs
is much more prevalent in the elderly population. Further research in the older
population as per age definition by WHO will improve the understanding of the
changes in platelet activity and the mechanisms driving these changes leading to
geriatric diseases due to physiological effects of ageing on platelets and cell signal-
ling more generally. This will enable the development of anti-platelet therapies,
particularly for the older population. The following section will describe the labo-
ratory investigation to detect the risk of bleeding events and thrombotic disease.

###### Laboratory Monitoring: Diagnostics, Tests, and Assays

Haemostatic markers that predict and detect the risk for both thrombosis and
haemorrhage are measurable in clinical pathology laboratories and are evaluated
against reference intervals based on a normal healthy adult population. It is
documented that age-related changes occur in both the procoagulant and the antico-
agulant factors (Favaloro et al. 2014 ), however, age-adjusted normal reference
intervals for an older population cease to exist. To understand how these haemostatic
markers evaluate a result for a patient, a description of common assays forfibrinogen
and coagulation is outlined.

###### Laboratory Principles of Tests and Assays for Fibrinogen

###### and Coagulation

Fibrinogen, also known as Factor I, is a coagulation factor that is essential for blood
clot formation. It is produced by the liver and released into the circulation along with
over 20 other clotting factors. Normally, when a blood vessel wall is injured the


324 R. Donkin et al.

coagulation cascade activates these factors and soluble circulatingfibrinogen con-
verts to insolublefibrinogen threads forming a mesh-like network. Platelets are
entrapped in thefibrin mesh forming a stable blood clot. This acts as a barrier
preventing additional blood loss, remaining in place until the injured vessel wall has
been repaired.
Increases in the levels or activity of any of the procoagulant proteins can lead to
faster or greater clot formation, and potentially to an increased prothrombotic risk
(Favaloro et al. 2014 ). It is well known that the plasma concentrations of many
coagulation factors increase in healthy humans in parallel with the physiological
processes of ageing (Franchini 2006 ; Mari et al.2008a, 2008b). This also includes
the important procoagulant proteinfibrinogen. Plasmafibrinogen levels are a
recognised risk factor for thrombotic disorders when in excess and this has been
shown to increase with advancing age (Kannel et al. 1987 ; Stone and Thorp 1985 ;
Wilhelmsen et al. 1984 ).
Coagulation tests are based on what happens in the test setting (in vitro) and thus
do not exactly reflect what is happening in the body (in vivo). Nevertheless, the tests
can be used to evaluate specific components of the haemostasis system (Pathology
Tests Explained- Fibrinogen 2021 ).
To understand coagulation testing and the pathways taken, it is important to know
the physiologic coagulation cascade that occurs in the body in vivo (previously
shown in Fig.12.1) and the coagulation testing cascade (Fig.12.5) that occurs
in vitrowhen coagulation testing is performed in the laboratory to determine whether

one or more of the coagulation factors is missing, deficient, or not functioning
properly or the patient is taking warfarin-related anticoagulants.
The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) measures those protein factors
that are part of the cascade referred to as the intrinsic pathway: XII, XI, IX, VIII, X,
V, II, andfibrinogen as well as prekallikrein (PK) and high molecular weight
kininogen (HK) (Pathology Tests Explained- Coagulation Cascade 2021 ). The
prothrombin time (PT test) measures the factors that make up the extrinsic pathway:
VII, X, V, II, andfibrinogen. It may be standardised as the International Normalised
Ratio (INR) which is a ratio of the patient‘s PT versus a normal sample. The INR
result is particularly important if a patient is taking a warfarin-related anticoagulant
drug (or has a bleeding disorder) to determine the drug‘s effectiveness by how much
it prolongs the PT or increases the INR. Of note, the INR test is not helpful with
monitoring the‘new’anticoagulants such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban.
Figure12.6illustrates the possible condition and interpretation of the PT and aPTT
results for a patient when results are normal or prolonged.
For both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways there are common factors across
both otherwise known as the common pathway. At the end of the common pathway
solublefibrinogen (factor I) has been changed into insolublefibrin threads which
form a mesh-like structure (Pathology Tests Explained- Coagulation Cascade 2021 ).
Thefibrin mesh along with aggregated platelets forms a stable blood clot.
A fibrinogenactivity test evaluates the function offibrinogen by measuring the
time it takes for afibrin clot to form following the addition of thrombin to plasma. A
fibrinogen activity test is used as part of an investigation of a possible bleeding
disorder or inappropriate blood clot formation. Low levels indicate reduced produc-
tion (Liver disease, inherited deficiency) or increased consumption (DIC, Fibrino-
lysis). Levels are elevated in an acute phase response which can be associated with
chronic inflammation in the elderly.


326 R. Donkin et al.

Fibrinogen is usually requested with PT, aPTT, platelets,fibrin degradation
products, and D-dimer to assist diagnosis for bleeding or thrombotic events. How-
ever, age-related changes in microcirculation and blood coagulation, ultimately
contribute to generating a hypercoagulable state withfibrinolysis markers such as
D-dimer concentration gradually increasing with age (Favaloro et al. 2014 ) therefore
interpretation of results should be mindful in an older population. Fibrinogen may be
used as a follow-up to an abnormal prothrombin time (PT) or activated partial
prothrombin time (aPTT) and/or an episode of prolonged or unexplained bleeding
(Pathology Tests Explained- Fibrinogen 2021 ). Occasionally,fibrinogen can be used
to help monitor the status of a progressive disease (such as liver disease) over time.
Sometimesfibrinogen is requested with other cardiac risk markers such as
C-reactive protein high sensitivity (hsCRP), to help determine a patient’s overall
risk of developing cardiovascular disease. This use of measuringfibrinogen levels
has not gained widespread acceptance though, because there are no direct treatments
for elevated levels. Afibrinogen antigen test can be ordered as a follow-up test to
determine if a decreased activity is caused by insufficientfibrinogen or dysfunctional
fibrinogen. This test measures the quantity of fibrinogen. It uses a fibrinogen
antibody to bind tofibrinogen in a blood sample (Pathology Tests Explained-
Fibrinogen 2021 ).
The reference values forfibrinogen are 1.5–4.0 g/L, with some variation between
methods (The Royal College of Pathologists Australasia 2021 ). Fibrinogen concen-
trations may rise sharply in any condition that causes inflammation, tissue damage,
or stress, such as surgery or inflammatory illnesses which may increase with age.
Elevated concentrations offibrinogen are not specific. Usually, these elevations are
temporary; returning to normal after the underlying condition has been resolved
(Pathology Tests Explained- Fibrinogen 2021 ). However, reference intervals that
determine whether concentrations offibrinogen are normal may not be age specific.
Not only do age-related mechanisms contribute tofibrinogen concentrations, in
addition to an increase of procoagulant proteins, hormonal decline with age also
increasesfibrinogen and other clotting factors (Wilkerson and Sane 2002 ; Lippi et al.
2014 ).
Other reasons for alteredfibrinogen results include blood transfusions within the
past month, drugs that may cause decreased levels, including anabolic steroids,
androgens, phenobarbital,fibrinolytic drugs (streptokinase, urokinase, tPA), and
sodium valproate. Moderate elevations infibrinogen may be seen sometimes with
pregnancy, cigarette smoking, and with oral contraceptives or oestrogen use (Lippi
et al. 2014 ).

###### Anticoagulation Therapeutics Amongst Older Adults

###### Heparin

Older patients are more likely to have a higher incidence of joint disease and undergo
subsequent knee arthroplasty, total or revision hip replacement (Jiang et al. 2019 ).


12 Fibrinogen, Coagulation, and Ageing 327

These medical procedures incur a risk of developing deep vein thrombosis which
may lead to a pulmonary embolism. Subsequently, patients are prescribed
anticoagulation therapeutics to minimise these risks (Warwick et al. 2007 ). Low
molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin are commonly used
for the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombus. More recently heparin has
been shown to inhibit the ability and activity of SARS-CoV-2 to replicate in host
cells and may have a potential role in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection (Li et al.
2021 ).
Heparin is a naturally occurring anticoagulant and for medical purposes was
initially extracted from bovine and porcine tissue that was originally purified from
the liver, consequently the therapeutic was named‘heparin’(Gray et al. 2008 ).
Although these drugs have a desirable anticoagulation effect, they have limitations
and reported adverse reactions (Pierce et al. 2015 ; Lieberman and Hsu 2005 ).
Limitations for LMWH in older adults occur when they are discharged from the
hospital after surgery, mostly due to the route of administration of the drug which is
commonly by subcutaneous injection. For an older patient, the administration
method of subcutaneous injection can be complicated and can result in poor med-
ication compliance. Because blood coagulation function needs to be regularly
monitored whilst taking LMWH, not only is compliance an issue but also accurate
and regular testing.

###### Warfarin

Patients with atrialfibrillation have afivefold higher risk of stroke, which increases
with age (Wolf et al. 1991 ). Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist and was one of the
first anticoagulants to be used to be highly effective in preventing stroke in atrial
fibrillation (Hart et al. 1999 ). Warfarin’s mechanism of action is to reduce the total
amount of clotting factors in the circulation by inhibiting the C1 subunit of vitamin K
epoxide reductase enzyme complex (Rost et al. 2004 ). This results in the liver’s
inability to produce vitamin K-depending clotting factors II, VII, IX, X, and the
endogenous anticoagulants proteins C and S.
However, warfarin dosing in patients for the prevention of stroke and those with
recurrent venous thrombosis or prosthetic heart valves is affected for several reasons,
including genetic variance in hepatic clearance, vitamin K handling, age, drug–drug
interactions, diet, alcohol consumption, and smoking (Flockhart et al. 2008 ). Foods,
beverages, and herbal supplementations that contain vitamin K, can affect how
warfarin works. Patients taking warfarin are advised to eat consistent amounts of
vitamin K-containing food on a week-to-week basis. This includes a reduction in
substantial amounts of leafy, green vegetables, or certain vegetable oils that contain
substantial amounts of vitamin K. Herbals or supplementations that contain coen-
zyme Q10 (Ubidecarenone) such as Echinacea, garlic, Ginkgo biloba, ginseng,
goldenseal, and St. John’s wort all interfere with the mechanism of action of warfarin
which is attributable to adverse events such as a bleeding episode. It is because of the


328 R. Donkin et al.

highly variable responses between individuals that patients require careful monitor-
ing of warfarin. This is particularly important in the elderly who require an
age-adjusted protocol with a recommendation to decrease the dose for patients
over 80 years old (Roberts et al. 2003 ).
Nonetheless, even with careful monitoring, warfarin dosing is associated with
challenges of achieving and maintaining levels within the narrow therapeutic range
that can lead to adverse events. Bleeding, particularly in the setting of over-
anticoagulation, is a major concern. Regular monitoring of the anticoagulant effect
is required through traditional laboratory monitoring through the international
normalised ratio (INR) although assessing the response of warfarin is complicated
by a delay of 2–3 days before the INR reflects any changes in warfarin dose.

###### Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC)

Oral anticoagulants have a major role in the prevention and management of cardio-
vascular disease and the associated complications. Two commonly used anticoagu-
lants are aspirin and warfarin. Aspirin is widely available and acts by impairing
platelet function permanently through inactivating cyclooxygenase (Gremmel et al.
2016 ).
Warfarin is a commonly prescribed vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for treating and
preventing thrombosis. However, warfarin has the disadvantage of a slow onset as it
takes several days to lower the levels of vitamin K factors, conversely, it also has a
slow offset with a half-life of 36–42 hours (Shameem and Ansell 2013 ). The slow
offset is a challenge especially when warfarin-treated patients require emergency
surgery. In addition, dietary interactions affect warfarin anticoagulation, frequent
laboratory monitoring is required (refer to testing section), and the risk of bleeding
complications because warfarin acts on multiple sites.
A small range of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) also known as novel/non-
vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOAC) or target-specific oral anticoagulants
(TSOAC) have been introduced to overcome the warfarin-associated disadvantages.
These agents target specific single coagulation enzymes—dabigatran inhibits throm-
bin, whilst apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban inhibit FXa (Lippi et al.
2019 ; Lin et al. 2020 ). Whilst DOAC provide the advantage of afixed dose
administration, rapid onset of action, fewer documented food and drug interactions,
no need for routine coagulation monitoring and improved patient satisfaction, the
risk of bleeding remains (Karcioglu et al. 2021 ). DOAC have been demonstrated to
be at least as effective as VKA for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and
stroke prevention in atrialfibrillation (Chan et al. 2016 ). DOAC in elderly patients is
increasing, but concerns have been raised especially for patients with impaired renal
function (Grandone et al. 2020 ). As ageing is associated with a decrease in glomer-
ular function this leads to compromised elimination of DOAC as well as any other
medication the patient may be taking. Consequently, drug accumulation may occur,
hence the recommendation is to manage the DOAC in elderly patients with extreme


12 Fibrinogen, Coagulation, and Ageing 329

caution (Grandone et al. 2020 ). Another recent concern refers to the use offixed-
dose DOAC for adult patients (Sebaaly and Kelley 2020 ; Mocini et al. 2021 ). The
prevalence of atrialfibrillation (AF) is known to increase with age, and obesity is
associated with AF. This has led the Italian National Association of Hospital
Cardiologists (ANMCO) to argue that pharmacokinetic data in extreme obesity
indicate that a patient with a high body mass index (BMI) may be undertreated
with the currentfixed dose protocol (Mocini et al. 2021 ).
The advantages of DOAC need to be considered with the challenges of reversing
the anticoagulant effects of DOAC, in situations of bleeding or the need for emergent
surgery. Dabigatran can be reversed using idarucizumab (Pollack Jr et al. 2015 ), and
apixaban and rivaroxaban using andexanet alfa, however, these agents are expen-
sive, and availability is limited (Mujer et al. 2020 ). It is also difficult to assess the
effectiveness of any reversal, as routine coagulation assays such as prothrombin time
(PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) lack the sensitivity to do this.
Currently, evidence for the use of warfarin over DOACs for anticoagulation is
strongest for patients with prosthetic valves, antiphospholipid syndrome, or a high
risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. For several clinical situations, including mitral
stenosis, obesity, altered gastrointestinal anatomy, pulmonary arterial hypertension,
renal or hepatic impairment, and left ventricular thrombus, evidence is lacking but
may eventually support the use of DOACs (Wadsworth et al. 2021 ).

###### Point-of-Care Testing—International Normalised Ratio

###### (INR)

Patients prescribed oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin or other vitamin K
antagonists must be monitored for over-anticoagulation which could result in bleed-
ing or haemorrhage, and under-anticoagulation resulting in a thrombotic event. The
therapeutic range is monitored by the international normalised ratio (INR). The
standard method for monitoring INR is done in the laboratory using a venesection
blood sample by a qualified scientist. However, point-of-care (POC) testing defined
as testing at or near where a patient is located, has the benefits of convenience for the
patient when self-managed by a portable device. The patient or clinician can self-
adjust the dose of the anticoagulant medication based on the results, using a
pre-determined algorithm or protocol. This results in receiving faster test results,
improving clinical outcomes, and reducing staff and laboratory resources. Point-of-
care testing of the INR can be done in other locations such as pharmacies which may
be more convenient andflexible for patients rather than a visit to a clinician or
hospital (Tideman et al. 2015 ).
Evidence suggests that patients who self-monitor using point-of-care testing may
have better outcomes and reduced risk of thromboembolic events, but an essential
prerequisite is the ability of the patient to use the testing devices correctly, compe-
tently, and safely (Heneghan et al. 2012 ; Christensen et al. 2007 ; Garcia-Alamino


330 R. Donkin et al.

et al. 2010 ). One factor that contributes to worse adherence is older age. Literature
describes the controversy over the influence of cognitive disorders, physical, and
functional disabilities that arise in old age that impact adherence to anticoagulation
therapy. Comorbidities associated with an older population including stroke, tran-
sient ischaemic attack, and dementia are all associated with poorer adherence to
testing and compliance with taking the correct dose (Gumbinger et al. 2015 ;
Horstmann et al. 2015 ; Jankowska-Polańska et al. 2016 ).

###### Point-of-Care Testing—ROTEM and TEG

Point-of-care haemostasis assays such as thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational
thromboelastometry (ROTEM) are gaining popularity and wider application. Both
the TEG and ROTEM are viscoelastic haemostatic assays that measure the visco-
elastic properties of whole blood clot formation, and there are comparisons of these
platforms (Ganter and Hofer 2008 ; Carll and Wool2020). The use of whole blood
provides the advantagefirstly of faster turn around time (as early as 10 minutes after
the assay begins) by avoiding the need for plasma separation. Secondly, the visco-
elastic information encompasses not only coagulation protein but also their interac-
tion with platelets, beginning with the initiation of the clot right through to clot
fibrinolysis. More recent versions of both platforms are very user friendly, do not
require specialised training and have a relatively small footprint allowing their
location in the ward, operation theatres, or laboratory. Conversely, it may be difficult
to ensure rigorous quality control of POCT instruments located outside a laboratory
(Srivastava and Kelleher 2013 ).
The newer TEG6s (Haemonetics) measure clot strength (as shown in Fig.12.7)
using the resonance method, in a microfluidic system contained in either a global

Fig. 12.7 TEG6s resonance detection (Haemonetics Corporation2015)


12 Fibrinogen, Coagulation, and Ageing 331

Fig. 12.8 TEG6s viscoelastic changes (Haemonetics Corporation 2015 )

haemostasis cartridge or platelet mapping cartridge (Haemonetics Corporation
2015 ). Although the previous TEG-5000 measured haemostasis via the rotation of
a pin immersed in a rotating cup both the TEG6s and TEG 5000 measure the same
viscoelastic properties (Lloyd-Donald et al. 2019 ).
TEG6s cartridges have four channels, hence four different assays are conducted
simultaneously. For example, as shown in Fig.12.8, the Global Haemostasis car-
tridge contains channels for kaolin (CK), functionalfibrinogen (CFF), rapid TEG
(CRT), and heparinase (CKH). Graphical representations of the viscoelastic changes
of all four channels (CK, CRT, CKH, and CFF) are generated as soon as the assay
starts, hence experienced users are often able to interpret results from 10 minutes
after the beginning of testing.
In a prospective comparison offirst-time cardiac surgery patients aged over
80 years against those aged under 60 years, Boldt and colleagues found significantly
different baseline TEG results (Boldt et al. 2002 ). With patients undergoing elective
orthopaedic surgery, ageing was weakly associated with changes in TEG variability
(Ng 2004 ). The Zheng et al. study of elderly patients aged 65 years or more,
concluded that currently adopted cut-off values for TEG indices are poorly and
modestly predictive of haemorrhage and obstruction (Zheng et al. 2013 ). A more
recent TEG6s study reported that some CK-K and CKH-K results on healthy blood
donors aged 60–78 years fell outside the manufacturer’s reference range (Donkin
and Fung 2020 ). Together thesefindings suggest that the adult reference range for
various TEG results may not always be suitable for older patients, hence the results
need to be interpreted carefully.
The whole blood sample on the ROTEM delta is static in a cup with a pin
suspended in it, and the signal from the pin is transmitted via an optical detector
system (Ganter and Hofer 2008 ). ROTEM has been used to guide blood manage-
ment in various clinical and surgical situations such as cardiac surgery (Ortmann
et al. 2015 ; Pearse et al. 2015 ). The newer ROTEM sigma like the TEG6s uses
cartridges and has been reported to have a strong correlation with the ROTEM delta
(Schenk et al. 2019 ). There are very few papers on the influence of age on ROTEM


332 R. Donkin et al.

results. A multi-centre study reported slightly enhanced clot formation in older
participants (Lang et al. 2005 ). A three-way comparison of healthy young, healthy
elderly, and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), found significantly higher
EXTEM clot formation time (CFT) and mean clot formation (MCF) in the healthy
elderly and CAD patients relative to young volunteers (Feuring et al. 2011 ). There
was no significant difference between the healthy elderly and CAD patients.
There are a few papers describing the utility of TEG and ROTEM to assess
DOAC anticoagulation. In a recent case study, serial TEG testing proved useful for
dabigatran reversal in a patient with acute kidney injury (Gilbert et al. 2021 ).
Modification of ROTEM appears to be able to detect DOAC activity (Vedovati
et al. 2020 ). In a different study, the CT and MCF of EXTEM and INTEM
demonstrated a strong and significant correlation with the plasma dabigatran con-
centration in an AF cohort (Sokol et al. 2021 ). Though limited in number, the
published data suggests that the general adult reference intervals for TEG and
ROTEM results may not represent the haemostasis in healthy older adults. This
highlights the need for studies to develop age-specific TEG and ROTEM reference
intervals to support the effective interpretation of results for the world’s rapidly
growing older population who will require effective anticoagulation, bleeding, and
blood management.

###### Implications and Future Directions

###### The Demands on Blood Supply for an Ageing Population

About 79% of blood in high-income countries is used by older adults for supportive
care, for example cardiovascular, haematology, solid malignancies, and massive
trauma (Tinegate et al. 2016 ; Geneva World Health Org. World health statistics
2021 ; Simon et al. 2021 ). As the majority of blood donors are younger adults these
figures predict future challenges to securing an adequate blood supply from younger
adults to meet the blood needs of older adults. Various strategies may be applied to
effectively manage blood use in older patients.
Haemostatic management of older patients on anticoagulants, anti-platelets, or
bleeding as discussed previously can be enhanced using reference intervals specific
to older adults. A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that liberal
transfusion strategies might be more beneficial for older patients (Simon et al.
2017 ). To explain this Simon et al. ( 2019 ) proposed an oxygen delivery capacity
model comparing young, middle-aged, and older adults (Simon et al. 2019 ). As
ageing is associated with changes in the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, this
reduces the maximal oxygen delivery capacity of older adults, especially under
metabolic stress. As a result, older adults are more susceptible to tissue hypoxia
than their younger counterparts. For example, the model predicts that an older adult
with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 100 g/L has a similar peak oxygen delivery capacity to a
young adult with a Hb of 70 g/L. Patient blood management (PBM) guidelines such


12 Fibrinogen, Coagulation, and Ageing 333

as those developed by the Australian National Blood Authority (National Blood
Authority 2021 ) have been developed to assist and guide healthcare professionals in
making clinical decisions about blood management. These guidelines aim to opti-
mise red cell mass, minimise blood loss and manage anaemia (Isbister 2013 ).
Unfortunately, even though older adults are the largest age cohort of blood users,
there is no PBM guideline dedicated to older adults.

###### Reference Intervals Specific to Older Adults

Laboratory results have an important role in the evidence-based management of
haemostasis, and effective interpretation of these results is reliant on relevant
reference intervals. There are different age-specific reference intervals for paediatric
patients but for most adult reference intervals there are no age-specific ranges despite
the rapidly growing older demographics. Ageing associated changes have been
reported in the haemostatic system (Wilkerson and Sane 2002 ; Franchini 2006 ;
Mari et al.2008a, 2008b; Bucciarelli and Mannucci 2002 ). A study of PT, aPTT,
and TEG 6 s global haemostasis on healthy blood donors aged over 60 years
revealed that some TEG6s and aPTT results did not fall within the recommended
reference intervals (Donkin and Fung 2020 ). Another study on health participants
reported‘platelet exhaustion’with ageing, as they found that circulating platelets
were more activated but lost their full aggregatory potential (Kuhnla et al. 2019 ). In
its 2020 Recommendations for Hemostasis Critical Values, Tests, and Reporting, the
International Council for Standardization in Haematology specified that age and
clinical conditions may affect critical value thresholds (Gosselin et al. 2020 ). Hence,
there is growing evidence for age-specific haemostasis reference intervals.

###### COVID-19 and Vaccinations, the Prevalence of Thrombotic

###### Events and Implications for an Older Population

###### with and without Comorbidities

The risk for severe illness with COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at
highest risk. People 65 and older who received both doses of either Pfizer or
Moderna vaccines showed a 94% reduced risk of COVID-19-related hospitalisation
(CDC 2021 ). Older adults are more likely to get very sick, particularly those aged
85 years and older which means that older adults with COVID-19 might need
hospitalisation, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they might
even die.The risk increases for people intheir 50s and increases in their 60s, 70s,
and 80s. Other factors and comorbidities can also put these people at risk of getting
severely ill with COVID-19.


334 R. Donkin et al.

A high prevalence of increased thrombotic events and prothrombotic pathophys-
iology has been observed through the infection of COVID-19. Both microvascular
and macrovascular thrombosis and embolism have been shown to develop in
COVID-19 patients in multiple organ systems (Loo et al. 2021 ; Chaudhary et al.
2021 ). A particularly high proportion of thromboembolic complications have been
reported to arise in haemodialysis circuits and in young, otherwise healthy patients
with no underlying predispositions to hypercoagulation despite the administration. It
is also becoming obvious that there is an increased risk of complications from
COVID-19 with increasing age (and thus increased benefit of vaccination), and the
potentially lower, but not zero, risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome
(TTS) with increasing age (ATAGI2021a, 2021b, 2021c).
COVID-19 represents a coagulopathy distinct from disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC). Numerous pathogenetic mechanisms may contribute to the
hypercoagulable state as commonly observed in COVID-19 infection. DIC is the
inappropriate activation of the tissue factor pathway of the coagulation cascade,
leading to the dissemination and deposition of platelet-fibrin thrombi in the micro-
vasculature. As this causes the rate of consumption of platelets and other
procoagulants, the patient gains a tendency to bleed. It has been demonstrated that
the coagulation changes mimic but are not identical to DIC (Levi and Toshiaki
2021 ). It would be reasonable to suppose that the hypercoagulation that can be
observed in cases of COVID-19 infection are due to the consequences of the overall
inflammatory response to infection and innate immune innervation. A range of
signalling pathways are activated in an infected state which results in the release
of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which is an auto-promoting process involving multi-
organ dysfunction as the immunological response causes significant damage to
tissues. Whilst the general principles of inflammation and increased coagulability
in critically ill patients are understood and reported, the precise physiological
mechanistic steps that occur to lead from COVID-19 infection to hypercoagulation
are not well understood. A plethora of proinflammatory cytokines and general
inflammatory markers are shown to be elevated in COVID-19 patients such as
C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate as well as ferritin and Von
Willebrand factor and Factor VIII. All of these have been reported by different
groups to have pro-thrombotic effects in other clinical scenarios, but their
pro-thrombotic relationship to COVID-19 has not been determined. COVID-19
hospitalised patients with a clinically prolonged activated partial thromboplastin
time (aPTT) were found to have a high level of lupus anticoagulant (91% of tested
patients) when compared to patients with an elevated aPTT that were not infected
with COVID-19 (Bowles et al. 2020 ). The clinical relevance of the elevation in lupus
anticoagulant is yet to be established, but this may be a contributor to thrombosis in
COVID-19.
Currently, there is insufficient literature to identify and describe the role, signif-
icance, and appropriate use of anticoagulant therapies on a large clinical scale in the
mitigation of hypercoagulation in COVID-19-afflicted patients. The enormous prev-
alence of this virus and the high rate of mortality resulting from thrombosis follow-
ing its infection should sufficiently motivate clinical studies in this area to ascertain


12 Fibrinogen, Coagulation, and Ageing 335

the true mechanisms of action and therefore develop appropriate therapies. There is
currently no targeted strategy for treating the hypercoagulative state observed in
COVID-19 infection and the current guidelines suggest thromboembolism prophy-
laxis for all patients in the absence of significant contraindications. Universal
therapeutic anticoagulation must be employed with great caution and monitoring
as there is a high likelihood of significant uncontrolled bleeding events with an
unrecognised benefit.
Whilst there is a significant health burden associated with thrombosis resulting
from COVID-19 infection, there is also a small number of cases reported that has
linked COVID-19 vaccination with thrombotic events. COVID-19 vaccines utilise
DNA and RNA technology, respectively. One of the newly developed and
implemented methods for vaccination is the introduction into tissues of a plasmid
containing the DNA sequence which encodes the antigen for which an immune
response should be developed. This relies on the production of the target antigen by
the host’s cellular machinery. There is not a significant difference between the
modes of action of effectiveness between DNA and mRNA vaccines. mRNA is a
more fragile molecular structure, therefore production may be considered more
difficult, but can also be considered generally safer than DNA vaccines, as there is
no potential for interruption in the host DNA sequence. The predominant COVID-19
vaccines that rely on mRNA technology are Comirnaty (tozinameran) by Pfizer
developed by the German biotechnology company BioNTech in collaboration with
American company Pfizer and Spikevax code named mRNA-1273 developed by
American company Moderna. The predominant COVID-19 vaccines that rely on
DNA technology are Covishield and Vaxzevria code named AZD1222 developed by
Oxford University UK and British-Swedish company AstraZeneca and Janssen
COVID-19 vaccine also called Johnson and Johnson COVID_29 vaccine developed
by Janssen vaccines in Netherland and Belgian Janssen Pharmaceuticals. For those
aged 60 years and above, the individual benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine
are greater than in younger people. The risks of severe outcomes with COVID-19
increase with age and are particularly high in older unvaccinated individuals. The
benefit of vaccination in preventing COVID-19 with COVID-19 Vaccine
AstraZeneca outweighs the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome
(TTS) in this age group and underpins its ongoing use in this age group (ATAGI
2021b). A very rare side effect involving blood clotting and low blood platelet count
may occur after the AstraZeneca vaccine. However, this condition is very rare and it
is less likely in older adults than in younger adults. For older persons, the benefits of
being protected from severe COVID-19 through vaccination greatly outweigh the
risk of harm from this condition (Australian Government Guidelines 2021 ).

###### Conclusion

Ageing is associated with changes to various aspects of the haemostatic system.
These changes have significant clinical implications in preventing thrombotic
events, managing anticoagulants, anti-platelets, and bleeding events. To support


336 R. Donkin et al.

more effective haemostatic management of the growing older demographic around
the globe, age-specific reference intervals that include clear values for those aged
60+ years are needed.

#### An Insight into Platelets at Older Age:

#### Cellular and Clinical Perspectives

Guadalupe Rojas-Sanchez and Pavel Davizon-Castillo

Abstract Higher access to medical care, advanced diagnostic tools, and overall
public health improvements have favored increased humans lifespan. With a grow-
ing proportion of older adults, the associated costs to care for ageing-associated
conditions will continue to grow. This chapter highlights recent cellular and clinical
evidence of platelets at an older age, from the hyperreactive phenotype associated
with thrombosis to the well-known hallmarks of ageing identifiable in platelets and
their potential functional implications on platelets at an older age. Therefore, it is
imperative to understand platelets’molecular and cellular mechanisms during ageing
in health and disease. New knowledge will favor the development of new ways to
prevent some of the age-associated complications where platelets are key players.

###### Introduction

Ageing is defined as a time-dependent, accumulative, and irreversible decline of
molecular, biochemical, and cellular functions (Kyriazis ; López-Otín et al.
). Ageing is influenced by intrinsic (genetics, epigenetics, sex, age) and extrin-
sic (lifestyle and environmental) factors (Passarino et al. ; Passarino et al. ;
Bellizzi et al. ; Alves et al. ) that have a direct effect on the development
and progression of chronic degenerative diseases. According to demographic pop-
ulation studies, by 2030, the proportion of older adults (over 60 years old) will reach
16.5% and 21.5% by 2050 (Un 2013 ). This demographic shift is likely the result of

an increased lifespan due to better access to medical care and management of
age-associated conditions (Meyer et al. 2020 ).
The impact of ageing on the hemostatic system is subtle but substantial. This can
range from abrupt development of life-threatening thrombotic or hemorrhagic events
to experiencing slight but significant functional alterations of its main components:
the coagulation system, thefibrinolytic system, or the cellular element, platelets.
Platelets are the essential cellular element of the hemostatic system in charge of
preserving vascular integrity and halting bleeding, therefore maintaining hemostasis.
This process initially requires tight coordination between platelets and coagulation
factors to form a thrombus to restore vascular integrity efficiently. Meanwhile, the
fibrinolytic component ensures that the growing thrombus does not enlarge beyond
the required size to restore hemostasis. When hemostasis is disrupted (i.e., inflam-
mation, infection, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or low platelet counts), the
thrombus enlarges and obstructs bloodflow, causing thrombosis.
Ageing is a major independent risk factor for thrombosis (Iyer and Dayal 2019 ;
Puurunen et al. 2018 ; Raskob et al. 2014 ). The impact of ageing on platelets has been
primarily associated with developing a hyperreactive platelet phenotype. Platelet
hyperreactivity is likely a key player in the significantly high incidence of throm-
bosis at an older age (Iyer and Dayal 2019 ; Puurunen et al. 2018 ). Remarkably, the
principal causes of death among the elderly have remained unmodified over 19 years
from 1990 to 2019 (Fig.13.1). However, despite their diverse etiologies, platelet
hyperreactivity and thrombosis are the most common pathophysiological mecha-
nisms underlying morbidity and mortality among the leading causes of death during
ageing (Raskob et al. 2014 ).

###### Qualitative Changes of Platelets at an Older Age

Platelets are the smallest, anucleate circulating blood cells with an 8–10 days
lifespan (Lebois and Josefsson 2016 ). Megakaryocytes are platelet precursors
whose function is significantly influenced by systemic and local cues in their bone
marrow niche (Haas et al. 2015 ; Baaten et al. 2017 ; Cognasse et al. 2019 ). The RNA
and organelles provided by megakaryocytes, to a large extent, define their functional
profile. Despite lacking a nucleus, transcriptome analysis of platelet RNA is a
common technique employed to gain an insight into the functional programming
conferred to platelets by megakaryocytes under health and disease conditions.
Platelets contain RNAs, mitochondria, alpha, dense granules, and lysosomes
acquired from megakaryocytes during thrombopoiesis. A small proportion of the
RNA found in platelets has been estimated to be either obtained by platelets
throughout their lifespan in circulation due to cellular crosstalk with immune or
endothelial cells. During thrombopoiesis, megakaryocytes synthesize (for the most
part) hundreds of bioactive molecules that are incorporated into alpha or dense
granules, as well as lysosomes. A small number of plasma proteins likefibrinogen,
VEGF, or factor V can instead be endocytosed by megakaryocytes and sorted into

Fig. 13.1 Principal causes of death among elderly between 1990 and 2019. The leading causes of
death have remained almost the same over time. A high incidence of thrombosis is associated with
the diseases highlighted in purple

platelet granules. Among many bioactive molecules, dense granules contain cal-
cium, serotonin, histamine, and ADP, which modulate bloodflow and amplify
platelet activation (Maynard et al. 2010 ; Maynard et al. 2007 ).
Platelets are essential for maintaining hemostasis and, under pathological condi-
tions, are critical participants in the pathophysiology of thrombosis (Xia et al. 2018 ;
Laffont et al. 2013 ).


346 G. Rojas-Sanchez and P. Davizon-Castillo

Platelets are unique cells that can go from a resting state to full activation and
aggregation in a matter of minutes. Platelets are the responsible cells for reaching
primary hemostasis. Briefly, at times of vascular damage (i.e., trauma), platelets
adhere to the damaged site through many surface receptors such as GpVI that bind to
collagen or GpIb, which can bind primarily to von Willebrand Factor. These
interactions initiate activation of the alpha IIb/Beta 3 receptor that binds soluble
fibrinogen and promotes platelet aggregation through platelet–fibrinogen–platelet
interactions. Platelet aggregates then incorporate soluble coagulation factors to form
larger clots. In parallel to this process, platelets release the contents of alpha and
dense granules as many of these bioactive molecules will enhance or amplify clot
formation. In summary, primary hemostasis requires tight coordination between
platelets (cells), coagulation factors (i.e.,fibrinogen and thrombin), and platelet
granules to stop vascular damage and bleeding.
Platelet hyperreactivity has been defined as a low threshold for activation by low
doses of agonists. Some of the mechanisms implicated include disruption of the
redox balance and inflammation. We have recently described that platelet
hyperreactivity in older mice (>18 months of age) is mainly due to chronic
TNF-α. Platelets from old mice exhibit higher activation of the alpha IIb/Beta
3 integrin after stimulating the thrombin and collagen pathways. Transcriptome
analysis of megakaryocytes from young and old mice revealed alterations in meta-
bolic pathways that underly platelet hyperreactivity in mice. Moreover, the use of an
anti-IL-1βinhibitor in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD),
elevated markers of inflammation, and a mean age of 61 years led to a significant
reduction in cardiovascular events. While platelet activation was not determined in
this study, it is possible to speculate that anti-IL-1βtreatment decreased platelet
hyperreactivity and contributed to the positive outcome of this study. Thus, ageing-
associated inflammation (inflammageing) is a crucial promoter of platelet
hyperreactivity.
Interestingly, dense granules increase proportionally according to age and corre-
late with frailty. Moreover, dense granules and platelet size are elevated in patients
with schizophrenia, suggesting a potential role for platelet granules in the physio-
pathology of some neurological disorders (Kessler et al.1995). Similarly, alpha
granules fuse with the plasma membrane to release their contents upon activation.
Alpha granules contain chemokines (that recruit and modulate immune cells), tissue
factors, coagulation factors,fibrinogen, and von Willebrand Factor (VWF). Higher
levels of alpha granule-specific proteins and platelet–leukocyte aggregates are found
in the plasma of older individuals compared to younger adults. Suchfindings suggest
higher activation of platelets in older individuals during circulation, therefore, a
lower threshold for activation. This ongoing activation would lead to platelet
degranulation and the formation of platelet–leukocyte aggregates (Mohebali et al.
2014 ).
In addition, platelets are important mediators of inflammation, angiogenesis,
wound repair, tissue remodeling, and host defense (Cognasse et al. 2019 ; Ed Rainger
et al. 2015 ; Lindemann et al. 2001 ; Singh et al. 2022 ; Pourkarim et al. 2022 ; Kisucka
et al. 2006 ). Non-hemostatic roles of platelets are dependent on some degree of


13 An Insight into Platelets at Older Age: Cellular and Clinical Perspectives 347

platelet activation. For example, higher amounts of exposed phosphatidylserine
(PS) increase the prothrombotic potential of platelets as coagulation factors require
PS to assemble and amplify coagulation. Similarly, low-grade degranulation of
platelets has been documented in humans and mice with diseases where platelets
are characteristically hyperreactive and are constantly undergoing some degree of
activation in circulation without necessarily triggering thrombosis. This is supported
by the identification of granule proteins like P-selectin on the surface of platelets and
the elevated levels of granule proteins and metabolites like serotonin (dense granule)
and platelet factor 4 (PF4) circulating in the plasma (Melki et al. 2021 ; Yamanishi
et al. 1985 ). Markers of degranulation such as P-selectin on the surface of platelets or
in circulation (soluble P-selectin) as well as higher levels of platelet-specific proteins
like PF4, RANTES, or serotonin have been identified in older individuals. These
findings suggest that at an older age, platelets have a lower threshold for activation in
circulation during ageing, resulting in low-grade platelet degranulation. For that
reason, the primary focus of the research surrounding platelet biology during ageing
focuses on identifying the mechanisms that regulate platelet hyperreactivity and
thrombosis.

###### Hallmarks of Ageing

Ageing is a well-conserved phenomenon in metazoans, and transcriptomic profiling
has proven to be a high throughput assay to identify the dysregulated pathways
between young and old humans and rodents. In this regard, extensive evidence has
led to the characterization of a series of signatures or hallmarks of ageing (López-
Otín et al. 2013 ): mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutri-
ent sensing, altered intercellular communication, epigenetic alterations, telomere
attrition, genomic instability, stem cell exhaustion, and cellular senescence. How-
ever, since platelets lack a nucleus, not all these hallmarks, such as telomere attrition
and stem cell exhaustion, apply (Fig.13.2 ). Moreover, some of these hallmarks have
not been studied in platelets from elderly subjects (Fig.13.3).

###### Genomic Instability and Epigenetic Alterations

Genomic instability and epigenetic alterations have been related to ageing (López-
Otín et al. 2013 ). Despite platelets lacking a nucleus, they do possess mitochondria.
Therefore, platelets have mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes 13 subunits
of the oxidative phosphorylation system, rRNAs, and tRNAs. During the ageing
process, mtDNA is prone to acquiring higher de novo mutations than the genomic
DNA (Wei Soong et al. 1992 ; Corral-Debrinski et al. 1992 ). mtDNA is synthesized
by polymerase gamma that has a high-fidelity function (Anderson et al. 2020 ). Its
exonuclease domain is sensitive to oxidation. Consequently, its exonuclease activity

is affected by high levels of ROS (Anderson et al. 2020 ). Hence, the frequency and
mutated nucleotides in mtDNA are significantly higher in older mice (10 months)
than in younger mice (1 month). These observations suggest that these types of
mutations increase and accumulate during the ageing process (Arbeithuber et al.
2020 ). There is no direct evidence of a higher frequency of mtDNA mutation in
platelet of older individuals. However, if that was the case, we could speculate that a
higher frequency of mutated mtDNA in platelets may have a functional impact on
platelets.
Besides the above evidence, mtDNA is sensitive to epigenetic modifications
(Fig.13.3). This is illustrated in platelets from patients with CVD. These platelets
exhibit hypermethylation of the Mitochondrially Encoded Cytochrome C Oxidase I
genes (MT-CO1, 2, and 3) and also of the Mitochondrially encoded tRNA leucine
1 (MT-TL1) gene (Baccarelli and Byun 2015 ). Similarly, in a different study,
hypermethylation of those same mitochondrial genes was a reliable predictor for
CVD incidence in obese patients (Corsi et al. 2020 ). Moreover, evidence of epige-
netic plasticity in platelets has been described in a recent publication (Bordoni et al.
2020 ). This evidence suggests that epigenetic changes in mtDNA of platelets are
related to the progression of ageing chronic degenerative diseases. Therefore, the
development and validation of assays to evaluate epigenetic modifications of
mtDNA in platelets may be an alternative to identify individuals at significant risk
for developing CVD at an older age.

###### Loss of Proteostasis

As per their etymological origin, proteins are the primary component of cells.
Proteins are regulated at several hierarchal processes such as transcription, transla-
tion, posttranslational modifications, and clearance by the autophagic and ubiquitin-
proteasome systems. Ageing and chronic degenerative diseases are characterized by
loss of proteostasis. This is manifested by improperly expressed proteins and by the
accumulation of misfolded or damaged proteins.
Platelets lack a nucleus and thus are incapable of executing the transcriptional
process de novo. However, during platelet formation (thrombopoiesis),


350 G. Rojas-Sanchez and P. Davizon-Castillo

megakaryocytes load platelets with plenty of RNAs. mRNA (Supernat et al. 2021 ),
miRNA (Landry et al. 2009 ), and lncRNAs (Yan et al. 2020 ) are present in platelets.
For this reason, transcriptome analysis of platelets is a valuable tool used to identify
relevant pathways modulating platelet function in disease states (Davizon-Castillo
et al. 2020 ). Evidence suggests that RNAs change over the lifespan of platelets.
Their decay is directly proportional to the increment of circRNA (Alhasan et al.
2016 ) and the decrease in protein translation rate (Angénieux et al. 2016 ).
Moreover, the plethora of RNAs in platelets allows them to selectively modulate
translation under normal and pathological stimuli (Schwertz et al. 2006 ; Denis et al.
2005 ). For example, Bcl-3 protein is only synthesized and detected in activated
platelets to participate in clot retraction (Weyrich et al. 1998 ). Similarly, tissue factor
(TF) mRNA present in platelets is spliced and subsequently translated upon activa-
tion. Expressed TF by activated platelets will then enhance the activation of coag-
ulation during clot formation (Schwertz et al. 2006 ). Also, platelets are important
mediators of inflammation. Upon an inflammatory stimulus such as lipopolysaccha-
ride, platelets trigger the splicing, translation, maturation, and secretion of potent
mediators of inflammation such as IL-1β (Brown and McIntyre, 2011 ) and
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) (Shashkin et al. 2008 ) therefore amplifying inflammation
in their surrounding environment.
Our understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on megakaryocytes and platelets
is a rapidly evolving area. Platelet hyperreactivity is characteristic of patients with
severe COVID-19 infection (Jakobs et al. 2022 ; Zaid et al. 2022 ; Barrett et al. 2021 ).
Among the different mechanisms of platelet hyperreactivity in COVID-19 infection,
dysregulation of the GpIb-IX-V /von Willebrand Factor (VWF) pathway has been
implicated (Ji et al. 2022 ). Elevated exposure of P-selectin on platelets of patients
with COVID-19 has also been found to increase the interaction of platelets and
leukocytes. This platelet–leukocyte crosstalk leads to Neutrophil Extracellular Traps
(NETs), which subsequently exacerbate tissue damage and promote thrombosis
(Middleton et al. 2020 ; Ng et al. 2021 ; Skendros et al. 2020 ). Altogether, it is also
plausible that several of the hallmarks of ageing underlying megakaryocytes and
platelets of older individuals and patients with chronic inflammatory comorbidities
(i.e., diabetes, obesity, and CVD) are exacerbated by COVID-19 infection. Such
disruptions by COVID-19 disease would likely increase platelet hyperreactivity and
thrombosis one of the leading causes of elevated morbidity and mortality of COVID-
19, particularly for individuals with pre-existing comorbidities and older age (Zhang
et al. 2022 ).
Non-coding RNAs have a role in platelet translation and horizontal gene regula-
tion. Analysis of the differential expression of noncoding RNA in platelets under
health or disease states has been employed as a biomarker for disease risk and drug
responsiveness (Shi et al. 2013 ; Marketou et al. 2019 ). This type of analysis has
proven helpful in studying age-associated diseases like hypertension or coronary
artery disease. For example, miR-22 and miR-223 levels are reduced in platelets
from hypertensive patients (Marketou et al. 2019 ). Furthermore, low miR-223 levels
have been correlated to low responsiveness to clopidogrel in patients with coronary
heart disease and platelet hyperreactivity (Shi et al. 2013 ).


13 An Insight into Platelets at Older Age: Cellular and Clinical Perspectives 351

Posttranslational modifications are important ways of regulating protein activity
and fate. For example, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can irreversibly oxidize
proteins by direct oxidation of amino acids (primary carboxylation) or by a second
carbonylation reaction (oxidized glycans or lipids oxidize proteins). These types of
modifications can lead to improper protein folding, promote unfolding, protein loss
of function, changes in metabolism, and as a result, a decrement in cellular viability.
For example, platelets from diabetic patients have high amounts of carbonylated
mitochondrial proteins correlated with a low ATP production (Avila et al. 2012 ).
Moreover, proteins from human platelets are carbonylated in an age-dependent
manner (Fig.13.3) (Jain et al. 2019 ) and directly proportional to ROS levels (Jain
et al. 2019 ). The proteasome degrades ubiquitin-tagged proteins by either the 26S
proteasome or, in the case of non-ubiquitin proteins, by the 20S proteasome. The
20S proteasome is responsible for recognizing and degrading carbonylated proteins.
However, protein oxidation can lead to the exposure of the protein hydrophobic
domain, which induces aggregates inhibiting the proteasome (Andersson et al. 2013 ;
Terman and Sandberg 2002 ; Sitte 2000 ). Protein aggregates may contain a complex
mixture of damaged proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, such as lipofuscin (Terman
and Sandberg 2002 ), which can generate ROS, triggering a vicious oxidative cycle.
Moreover, the electron transport chain (ETC) and proteins are prone to carbonylation
and hydroxynonenal (HNE) adduction (Choksi et al. 2004 ) (such as ETC and
VTAC). These modifications give rise to mitochondrial dysfunction, opening the
mitochondrial permeability pore, inducing the generation of more ROS, and releas-
ing the cytochrome C (Choksi et al. 2004 ). Besides proteasome activity inhibition by
protein aggregates, proteasome activity declines with age (Saez and Vilchez 2014 ).
The proteasomal activity of platelets during ageing has not been investigated;
however, its role in platelet formation (thrombopoiesis) lifespan has. The conditional
deletion of PSMC1 (a subunit of the 26S proteasome) in mice induced thrombocy-
topenia accompanied by a lethal postnatal phenotype (Shi et al. 2014 ). Moreover,
inhibition of the proteasome leads to the accumulation of the proapoptotic protein
Bax triggering phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and increasing the clearance of
platelets. Altogether, proteasome inhibition shortens the lifespan of platelets (Nayak
et al. 2013 ). Moreover, pharmacological proteasome inhibition by MG132 and
bortezomib decreases platelet activation (Gupta et al. 2014 ; Shi et al. 2014 ). Whether
the mild inhibition of platelet activation is solely by altering platelet proteostasis or
due to disruption of other metabolic routes in platelets remains to be evaluated.
Another regulator of protein turnover is the autophagic process. Autophagy is a
housekeeping program that allows the degradation of damaged and aggregated
proteins and damaged organelles (such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum,
and peroxisomes), RNA, and lipids (Dikic and Elazar 2018 ). Autophagy is always
active at low basal levels; however, it can be triggered by different types of stress
such as low levels of amino acids, nutrients, growth factors, ROS, DNA damage, and
UV radiation (Dikic and Elazar 2018 ). Mammalian cells possess three types of
autophagy: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy
(Parzych and Klionsky 2014 ). However, until now, macroautophagy (hereafter
referred to as autophagy) has been the most studied type of autophagy investigated


352 G. Rojas-Sanchez and P. Davizon-Castillo

in megakaryocytes and platelets. It has been determined that autophagy is essential
for megakaryopoiesis, thrombopoiesis, and platelet activation. Genetic ablation of
the autophagic process in mice causes thrombocytopenia due to alterations in
thrombopoiesis (Cao et al. 2015 ). Moreover, as the autophagic process is also critical
for full platelet activation, its inhibition also results in a deficient platelet activation
(Feng et al. 2014 ). Therefore, autophagy is critical for platelet generation
(thrombopoiesis) and adequate platelet activation in mice.
In humans, platelets from patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)
(characterized by a reduced platelet count due to immune-mediated clearance of
platelets) exhibit activation of mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a negative
regulator of autophagy (Wang et al. 2019 ). Thesefindings suggest that platelets from
patients with ITP have decreased autophagy; thus, their function might be inade-
quate if their autophagicflux is disrupted. Moreover, Sirolimus, an inhibitor of
mTOR, has been shown to improve platelet counts in patients with refractory
(minimal to no clinical response to standard treatments) ITP (Wang et al. 2019 ).
While Sirolimus is primarily employed as an immunomodulator (to decrease platelet
clearance), it is plausible to speculate that Sirolimus induces autophagy in megakar-
yocytes and platelets, which in turn, ameliorates thrombocytopenia by improving
thrombopoiesis (platelet formation) and platelet function (Feng et al. 2020 ). In
summary, evidence suggests that autophagy is necessary for adequate megakaryo-
cyte and platelet function. However, the autophagicflux status of platelets during
ageing and its impact on platelet hyperreactivity and thrombosis remains to be
elucidated.

###### Mitochondrial Dysfunction

Excessive generation of ROS is considered one of the main consequences of
mitochondria dysfunction (López-Otín et al. 2013 ). Endogenous and exogenous;
ROS, particularly H 2 O 2 , enhance the activation of murine and human platelets
(Dayal et al. 2013 ; Pratico et al. 1992 ; Canoso et al. 1974 ; Levine et al. 1976 ).
Exposure of platelets to H 2 O 2 activates the production of thromboxane A2 (TxA2),
which lowers the activation threshold of platelets by low doses of platelet agonists.
Thus, in a way, H 2 O 2 exerts a priming effect over platelets (Pratico et al. 1992 ;
Praticòetal. 1991). Platelets from older (>60 years old) patients with acute coronary
syndrome, therefore, with activated platelets, exhibit an inversely proportional
relation between decreased glutathione peroxidase (GPx (antioxidant potential)
and amounts of circulating ROS (Holley et al. 2016 ). Moreover, elevated markers
of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are directly correlated with platelet
hyperreactivity and frailty in older adults (Arauna et al. 2020 ). Therefore, a growing
body of evidence suggests that assessment for frailty in older adults could be a
helpful tool to identify older individuals at risk for thrombotic events that might
benefit from interventions to reduce ageing-associated thrombosis.


13 An Insight into Platelets at Older Age: Cellular and Clinical Perspectives 353

Our own and other teams have found that platelets from old mice accumulate
mitochondria in a TNF-α-dependent way (Fig.13.3), likely due to disrupted
autophagicflux. While not directly investigated, it is plausible to hypothesize
that a significant fraction of the mitochondria accumulated in platelets from
older mice is dysfunctional, are therefore prone to generate higher amounts of
endogenous ROS (Davizon-Castillo et al. 2019 ). In a different study, investigators
found that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent ROS scavenger, ameliorates platelet
hyperreactivity in older mice (Yang et al. 2016 ). Consequently, endogenously
generated platelet ROS are essential modulators of platelet activity.
Finally, inflammation is another relevant contributor to oxidative stress in plate-
lets. Our work shows that ageing-associated platelet hyperreactivity in old mice is
associated with TNF-α-driven inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent
evidence indicates that TNF-αdirectly induces ROS production in platelets, priming
platelets for activation (Naime et al. 2019 ). Consequently, it is possible to hypoth-
esize that TNF-α-driven inflammation in old mice promotes platelet hyperreactivity
to a certain extent due to the direct induction of ROS by platelets.
Altogether, mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with platelet hyperreactivity
in ageing. The current evidence points toward a multifactorial process that includes
decreased antioxidant potential, direct stimulation of ROS production by inflamma-
tory cytokines like TNF-α, or even dysregulation of the mechanisms for clearance of
dysfunctional mitochondria like autophagy and mitophagy. While the employment
of antioxidants for older individuals seems like an apparent intervention, historical
evidence of serious bleeding complications in older adults taking over-the-counter
antioxidants calls for caution (Schiavon et al. 1984 ; Steiner 1983 ; Freedman 2008 ).
Several research groups devote our time to increasing our understanding of the
mechanisms that underly platelet hyperreactivity to develop new safe, and cost-
effective therapies to modulate this age-associated deleterious platelet phenotype.

###### Altered Intercellular Communication

Secretion occurs upon activation; thus, platelet-mediated secretion is a pivotal
modulator of wound healing, inflammation, angiogenesis, and senescence. Platelet
secretion is mediated by alpha granules, dense granules, lysosomes, and extracellular
vesicles (EV) such as exosomes and microparticles. These granules contain over
250 different bioactive molecules that confer to platelets the potential to participate
in modulating other functions beyond hemostasis and thrombosis. For example,
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) contained in alpha granules can promote
angiogenesis (Etulain et al. 2013 ). Chemokines like RANTES, MIP-1α, or CXCL4
facilitate the recruitment of lymphocytes and neutrophils at damaged sites (Fig.13.3)
(Gleissner et al. 2008 ). P-selectin present in alpha granules promotes cellular
inflammation by assisting with the recruitment of monocytes through PSGL-1
present on the surface of monocytes and endothelial cells (da Costa Martins et al.
2007 ; Celi et al. 1994 ; Ivanov et al. 2019 ).


354 G. Rojas-Sanchez and P. Davizon-Castillo

Diseases that affect platelet delta granules like Hermansky Pudlack Syndrome
(HPS) or alpha granules such as Grey Platelet Syndrome (GPS) are characterized by
either altered formation (decreased number) or alterations in the secretory machin-
ery. Patients with these types of modifications in platelet granules typically exhibit a
clinical bleeding phenotype due to reduced platelet numbers (impaired
thrombopoiesis) or the inability to release granule contents upon activation to
enhance primary hemostasis. This highlights the importance of platelet granule
bioactive molecules that participate in hemostasis. In addition, alterations in the
regulatory components of platelet granule formation or secretion often affect innate
immunity or result in immune dysregulation. For example, some forms of HPS are
accompanied by diminished degranulation of Natural-Killer cells (Boeckelmann
et al. 2021 ). Similar alterations have been reported in patients with GPS where
leukocytes exhibit altered granule secretion, which predisposes patients to immune
dysregulation and autoimmunity.
Platelets can participate in endothelial remodeling through the release
of chromogranin (a monocyte chemoattractant precursor), cyclophilin A, and vas-
cular smooth muscle cell growth factor via EV, which colocalize in atherosclerotic
lesions (Coppinger et al. 2004 ). Thus, platelets are active participants in arterial wall
remodeling and plaque stability (Coppinger et al. 2004 ). Additionally, plaque
rupture activates platelets, inducing arterial thrombosis, the cause of stroke and
myocardial infarction.
The two leading causes of death in cancer are thrombotic events (Khorana 2010 )
and metastasis (Dillekås et al. 2019 ), of which platelets are essential modulators.
Platelet–tumor cell interaction may induce platelet activation enhancing the release
of growth factors from platelet granules and thus fueling tumor growth and
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (Guo et al. 2019 ; Labelle et al. 2011 ). In this
regard, activated platelets release TGFβ, activating macrophages and neutrophils,
which induce a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. Additionally, platelet–cancer
cell aggregates protect cancer cells from shear forces and help them to colonize
secondary niches (Lambert et al. 2017 ).
Alzheimer’sdisease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease character-
ized by memory and cognitive impairment and is the most common worldwide cause
of dementia (Breijyeh and Karaman 2020 ). The strongest risk factor for AD is
ageing, and platelets contribute to the physiopathology of AD (Ferrer-Raventós
and Beyer 2021 ). Platelets from patients with AD contain less dense granules
(Kessler et al. 1995 ) which is directly proportional to the clinical severity of
dementia (Tajeddinn et al. 2016 ). One of the main features of AD is the formation
of senile neocortical plaques, which are mainly constituted by the amyloid-βpeptide
(Aβ) (Sun et al. 2015 ). Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by
γ/β-secretase generates Aβ. In AD, accumulation of Aβin neurons increases the
production of ROS that causes neurodegeneration (Sun et al. 2015 ). Platelets contain
both APP and Aβwhich can be released upon activation by collagen or arachidonic
acid. Platelets are considered the primary source of the circulating APP. Platelets
from AD patients exhibit approximately 17% moreβ-secretase activity than healthy
elderly individuals (Johnston et al. 2008 ). Therefore, platelets are critical players in


13 An Insight into Platelets at Older Age: Cellular and Clinical Perspectives 355

the physiopathology of AD as they contain the elements required for the formation
of Aβ. More recent evidence demonstrates that 22% of the total number of platelets
from a mouse model of AD (APP mouse model) accumulate in the brain compared to
controls, indicating a significant adhesion of AD platelets to the cerebral vasculature
(Kniewallner et al. 2020 ). Platelets from mice with AD not only exhibit
hyperreactivity but also, in the presence of Aβthese platelets form stronger clots
resistant to thrombolysis (Cortes-Canteli et al. 2010 ). Moreover, platelets from older
mice with AD (APP mouse model) transferred to control young mice led to the
formation of Aβaccompanied by cognitive deterioration in the control young mice
(Wu et al. 2021 ).

###### Cellular Senescence

Cellular senescence has been defined as a state of replicative cell death (Kumari and
Jat 2021; Di Micco et al. 2021 ; Blagosklonny 2003 ). In general, nucleated senescent
cells remain viable but can display morphological changes, metabolic alterations,
gene expression changes, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).
Given that platelets lack a nucleus, only a few senescence-associated features can
be assessed. For instance, platelets are not subjected to the same checkpoints as
nucleated cells due to the lack of nuclear DNA. Therefore, their senescence pheno-
type is substantially divergent from one of nucleated cells. Platelet senescence at an
older age has not been addressed. Instead, thefield has focused on studying platelet
senescence throughout their lifespan in circulation. Studies focusing on understand-
ing the mechanisms that regulate platelet senescence and apoptosis aim to identify
interventions that could delay these processes. Such discoveries could significantly
impact the way platelets are stored for transfusion.
The estimated lifespan of platelets is 5–10 days. In blood banks, platelets are
stored for up to 5–7 days (Arbeithuber et al. 2020 ). Thus, considering that platelets
are prone to activation ex vivo, a prolonged storage time can increase the likelihood
of activation and even accelerate cell death. Some of the main senescence events
found in platelets ex vivo are activation of an intrinsic platelet apoptotic pathway
modulated by a decline of Bcl-XLlevels relative to Bak that would lead to the
activation of Bak to trigger apoptosis (Dowling et al. 2010 ), exposure of
phosphatidylserine (Dasgupta et al. 2010 ; Rand et al. 2004 ; Pereira et al. 2002 )
and the formation of platelet-to-platelet aggregates of apoptotic platelets. Shedding
of the collagen receptor GpVI and the primary receptor for von Willebrand Factor
(VWF) are also some of the manifestations of platelet senescence (Hartley 2007 ).
Another critical characteristic of senescence is the senescence-associate secretory
phenotype (SASP), which endows senescent cells with the ability to modify their
microenvironment through the secretion of bioactive molecules (Venturini et al.
2020 ). This process is thought to alter the microenvironment to favor diverse
physiological and pathological processes. In that regard, senescent platelets during
storage release extracellular vesicles enriched for miRNAs distinct signatures


356 G. Rojas-Sanchez and P. Davizon-Castillo

characteristic of cardiometabolic and vascular signature diseases (Pienimaeki-
Roemer et al. 2017 ). Whether the release of miRNAs during platelet storage is due
to SASP or secondary to platelet activation remains to be investigated.

###### Dysregulated Nutrient Sensing

Nutrient-sensing pathways are signaling pathways known to modulate ageing and
age-related conditions. Some of the main pathways identified include insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and mTOR. Briefly, overactivation of these pathways leads
to ROS generation, therefore, inducing cellular ageing. Numerous studies have
demonstrated that pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that
modulate the activity of some of these nutrient-sensing pathways are linked to an
extended lifespan. For example, caloric restriction and fasting, interventions that
ameliorate signaling through the IGF-1 and mTOR pathways (decreasing the gen-
eration of ROS) have been associated with an increased life expectancy in short-
lived species like rodents (Mitchell et al. 2019 ; Heilbronn and Ravussin 2003 ).
The role of nutrient-sensing pathways during ageing on platelet development in
humans and its functional impact have not been performed. Despite this, a few
studies provide an overview of possible ways nutrient-sensing pathways modulate
platelet function during ageing. High mTOR activity and increased levels of ROS
underly platelet hyperreactivity in aged mice as both mTOR inhibition by
Rapamycin or the use of N-acetylcysteine (ROS scavenger) ameliorated their
hyperreactive platelet phenotype (Yang et al. 2016 ).
Similarly, the role of IGF-1 on platelet development and function during ageing
has not been investigated. Nutrient sensing through the IGF-1 pathway is another
relevant signaling route associated with promoting longevity (Junnila et al. 2013 ).
Platelets, in addition to expressing the receptor for IGF-1, also store and release
IGF-1 upon activation (Hers. 2007 ). Released IGF-1 can enhance platelet activation
in a paracrine manner (Kim et al. 2007 ). Therefore, it is possible to speculate that
elevated levels of IGF1 or aberrant signaling through the IGF1 pathway might
promote the development of platelet hyperreactivity and thrombosis at an older age.

###### Concluding Remarks

Platelet hyperreactivity is the most studied aspect of platelets at an older age.
Chronic inflammation has been associated with the development of platelet
hyperreactivity during ageing. However, given that ageing is a time-dependent
loss of function of multifactorial origin it is necessary to expand our investigations
to determine if and which of the many hallmarks of ageing contribute to ageing-
associated platelet hyperreactivity. Understanding the mechanism that underly this


13 An Insight into Platelets at Older Age: Cellular and Clinical Perspectives 357

functional phenotype is of great importance to developing new therapies to decrease
ageing-associated thrombosis.

Abstract In 1999, in a review by Beardsley, the potential of adult stem cells, in
repair and regeneration was heralded (Beardsley Sci Am 281:30–31, 1999). Since
then, thefield of regenerative medicine has grown exponentially, with the capability
of restoring or regenerating the function of damaged, diseased or aged human tissues
being an underpinning motivation. If successful, stem cell therapies offer the poten-
tial to treat, for example degenerative diseases. In the subsequent 20 years, extensive
progress has been made in the arena of adult stem cells (for a recent review see
(Zakrzewski et al. Stem Cell Res Ther 10:68, 2019)). Prior to the growth of the adult
stem cell research arena, much focus had been placed on the potential of embryonic
stem cells (ESCs). Thefirst research revealing the potential of these cells was
published in 1981, when scientists reported the ability of cultured stem cells from
murine embryos, to not only self-renew, but to also become all cells of the three germ
layers of the developing embryo (Evans and Kaufman Nature 292:154-156, 1981),
(Martin Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 78:7634-7638, 1981). It took almost 20 years,
following these discoveries, for this technology to translate to human ESCs, using
donated human embryos. In 1998, Thomson et al. reported the creation of thefirst
human embryonic cell line (Thomson et al. Science 282:1145–1147, 1998). How-
ever, research utilising human ESCs was hampered by ethical and religious con-
straints and indeed in 2001 George W. Bush restricted US research funding to
human ESCs, which had already been banked. The contentious nature of this
arena perhaps facilitated the use of and the research potential for adult stem cells.
It is beyond the scope of this review to focus on ESCs, although their potential for
enhancing our understanding of human development is huge (for a recent review see
(Cyranoski Nature 555:428–430, 2018)). Rather, although ESCs and their epigenetic
regulation will be introduced for background understanding, the focus will be on
stem cells more generally, the role of epigenetics in stem cell fate, skeletal muscle,

###### Stem Cells

Stem cells, regardless of whether they are embryonic or adult, have the defining
features that they are capable of self-renewal and of specialisation. Following
fertilisation of the human egg and thefirst three divisions of the zygote, 8 cells
exist, which are referred to astotipotentcells and which have the capacity to form an
intact human (Stewart 2004 ; Juliandi et al. 2011 ). As division continues, the number
of stem cells increases, but their ability to form an intact embryo (individually)
decreases. Within 5 days post-fertilisation of the human egg, the blastocyst forms,
giving rise to an outer cell layer, which will generate the placenta and an inner cell
mass of ~30–50 cells, from which the embryo develops. These inner cells are
referred to aspluripotentembryonic stem cells (ESCs). Although they can individ-
ually develop into all cell types in the body (~ 216 different cell types), they are not
individually capable of forming a human being (Stewart 2004 ; Juliandi et al. 2011 ).
As embryonic development progresses, the cells become more specialised, commit-
ting to lineage-specific fates, with genes critical for earlier phases of development
being switched off, with only those required for specific tissue function or phenotype
remaining active. A small population of cells, within these tissues, however, remain
only partially differentiated and are capable of limited, local specialisation, being
generally activated during disease or following damage; these cells are referred to as
multipotentstem cells (Stewart 2004 ; Juliandi et al. 2011 ).
Adult stem cells generally fall into this multipotent (or indeed unipotent) cate-
gory. It is important to note, however, that adult somatic cell fate can be
reprogrammed, via a process of de-differentiation back to an embryonic-like state.
This reversal of potency was induced via the genomic integration of 4 key embry-
onic genes: Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/c-Myc, as demonstrated in the pioneering work of
Takahashi and Yamanaka ( 2006 ). Using adult murinefibroblasts as a model, they
were thefirst to demonstrate that differentiated adult murine skin cells could be
induced to a pluripotent state, creating thefirstinduced pluripotentstem cell (iPSC)
model. One year later, the potential of this concept was independently proven using
adult humanfibroblasts by the groups of Yamanaka and Thomson (Takahashi et al.
2007 ; Yu et al. 2007 ). Although beyond the scope of this review, it is important to
note that since these early discoveries, multiple adult cell types from a variety of
different species have been used to develop iPSCs using retro-, lenti- and adeno-viral
vectors for the transfer of the reprogramming factors (Ye et al. 2013 ). The model
iPSCs have been used to study processes of development (Cui et al. 2022 ),
reprogramming and disease (Meir and Li 2021 ).
Following fertilisation, as multicellular organisms develop, cellular functions
diversify. These changes enable tissue development and function at the expense of


14 Ageing Skeletal Muscle: The Ubiquitous Muscle Stem Cell 367

developmental potential. There is a fundamental need for committed cells, in
multicellular organisms, to enable our performance and our survival. The control
of stem cell differentiation and hence fate is in part under the control of epigenetic
regulation (Meir and Li 2021 ).

###### Epigenetics

Lifestyle and environmental factors that result in modifications to DNA and his-
tones, without changing the DNA sequence, occur as a result of epigenetic modifi-
cations or tags. These epigenetic‘tags’, which open or condense chromatin, include
(1)histone acetylationon lysine residues, performed by Histone Acetyl Transferases
(HATs), which mark transcriptionally competent regions of DNA and culminate in
chromatin opening, thereby facilitating target gene transcription. By contrast,his-
tone deacetylases(HDACs) cause lysine deacetylation, resulting in hypoacetylated
histones, which are often associated with transcriptionally inactive chromatin struc-
tures; (2)histone methylation, performed by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, leads
to chromatin condensation and results in repressed transcription. DNA methylation
(hypermethylation) of cytosine–guanine (C–G) pairings, especially in CpG-rich
regions and in important regulatory regions such as promoters, typically leads to
chromatin condensation and repressed transcription (Jones et al. 1998 ; Bogdanović
and Veenstra 2009 ). Reduced methylation (hypomethylation) provides a more
relaxed chromatin structure, enabling gene expression to occur (Jones et al. 1998 ;
Bogdanovićand Veenstra 2009 ).

###### Epigenetics and Stem Cell Fate

As the embryo develops and the stem cells transition down a committed cell lineage
route, extensive changes in gene expression occur. These changes are governed by
alterations in DNA methylation and histone acetylation, both of which are critical for
enabling the differing roles of stem cells, including self-renewal, specialisation and
differentiation (Wu and Sun 2006 ). Driven by intrinsic and extrinsic cues, through-
out embryonic and post-partum growth and development, reciprocal gene expression
occurs, whereby genes associated with self-renewal are silenced, enabling transcrip-
tion of cell type-specific genes during differentiation and vice versa. Thesefluid
changes in gene expression and repression are underpinned by unique epigenetic
mechanisms, which restrict developmental plasticity through changes in DNA
methylation and chromatin modifications in an inheritable manner (for recent
reviews see (Wu and Sun 2006 ; Meir and Li 2021 )). Epigenetic regulation of adult
stem cell behaviour is also critical. This is not surprising, even though they face
lineage restrictions, since to be defined as stem cells, these cells need to have the
capacity to self-renew and differentiate. The importance of epigenetic regulation of


368 C. E. Stewart

adult stem cell behaviour will be revisited in the section‘Ageing, Epigenetics and
Skeletal Muscle’.

###### Adult Stem Cells and Their Potential

Technological advances in cell and molecular biology have contributed to our
understanding of the physical cues and biological signals that control cellular
phenotype and behaviour in health and disease, with injury and repair and across
the ageing spectrum. These developments have enabled the manipulation of stem
cells in culture, providing an understanding of how differentiation is controlled and
how it can be manipulated. Historically, because of the perceived difficulties in
working with adult stem cells (low numbers obtainable and problems of senescence),
many argued that studying pluripotent ES cells would expedite the development of
stem cell therapies. However, more recently and given the potential for autonomous
stem cell therapies provided by adult stem cells, these cells have gained interest and
traction. Indeed, to understand how adult tissues repair and regenerate (at a cellular
and niche level), requires the study of adult stem cells—afield of research that is
growing to include 3D and organoid investigations of adult stem cell behaviour
in vitro. The growth, repair and regeneration of many adult tissues rely on the ability
to resident adult stem cells to undertake these tasks, with evidence being generated
using primary and immortalised adult stem cells, where ethical and religious con-
straints are less prevalent. For the purposes of this chapter, the focus will be on the
adult skeletal muscle stem cell and the impact of ageing on its behaviour (for a recent
review on the regulators of mesenchymal (bone, adipose, muscle and cartilage) stem
cell differentiation see Rauch and Mandrup ( 2021 ))).

###### Skeletal Muscle

Muscle contributes the greatest tissue mass to the healthy human body, consisting of
smooth and striated forms. The former is present in the walls of the gastrointestinal
system, the genitourinary urinary tract and blood vessels and is under involuntary
control. Cardiac and skeletal muscles are striated, with the former being under
involuntary and the latter under voluntary control (Sweeney and Hammers 2018 ).
Over 600 different skeletal muscles are present in the human body (Brooks 2003 )
andtheycomprise approximately 40% of the healthy young adult human mass.
Skeletal muscle is essential for growth, posture, locomotion and storage/provision of
energy (Csapo et al. 2020 ). Muscle mass increases during childhood, puberty and
following resistance training interventions. By contrast, ageing, disease and disuse
result in loss of muscle mass and strength. Skeletal muscle is essential for survival,
with muscle wasting in cancer (cachexia) affecting approximately 50% of cancer


14 Ageing Skeletal Muscle: The Ubiquitous Muscle Stem Cell 369

patients and accounting for 20–30% of all cancer deaths; indeed, death normally
occurs when losses of mass exceed 30–40% (Saini et al. 2006 ).
Given the important metabolic, physiological and functional roles that skeletal
muscle plays, its development and subsequent adaptability are key to health and
quality of life.

###### Skeletal Muscle Development—Role of the Stem Cell

The development and adaptability of skeletal muscle is a highly coordinated process.
Although debate exists regarding the precise source of myogenic cells in the trunk
and limb, they are believed to be derived from the somites (temporary mesoderm-
derived segments, located in pairs on either side of the neural tube in developing
vertebrate embryos (Stockdale et al. 2000 )). Progenitor cells originating from the
hypaxial domain of the somites migrate to the limb buds, where they divide and
begin to express muscle-specific determination factors, influenced by signals from
neighbouring tissues (Hawke and Garry 2001 ; Buckingham et al. 2003 ). Further-
more, these cells derived from the hypaxial somites also reportedly give rise to the
abdominal and diaphragm muscles, whereas most muscles of the head originate from
cranial mesoderm (Ono et al. 2010 ).
Briefly, within murine models, primary musclefibres form at approximately
11 – 14 embryonic days in the limbs. These are followed at embryonic days 14– 16
by secondaryfibre formation, which is followed by innervation (Ontell and Kozeka
1984a, 1984b; Cossu and Biressi 2005 ; Messina and Cossu 2009 ). A similar but
slower pattern of primary and secondaryfibre formation and innervation is reported
in human embryonic development, where myogenic progenitor cells migrate to limb
buds at approximately 6 weeks of gestation, where they differentiate into myoblasts.
Following multiple rounds of proliferation between weeks 7 and 9, they fuse to form
multinucleated primary myotubes attached via tendons to bones. Secondary
myotubes, which initially share a common basement membrane, subsequently
form, at which point, histologically recognisable muscle is well defined. From
11 weeks, thefibres grow in length and in cross sectional area and by 6 months of
gestation in the human embryo, the number offibres is reportedly set, with further
growth occurring as a result of increased cross sectional area, not increasedfibre
numbers (Jones and Round 2007 ).

###### Skeletal Muscle Stem Cells

Given that skeletal musclefibres are terminally differentiated and themselves inca-
pable of replication, their ability to adapt to physiological and pathological cues is of
particular scientific interest. Insight into the mechanisms enabling the adaptability of
skeletal muscle was described over 60 years ago, by Mauro, who reported (using


370 C. E. Stewart

electron microscopy) the presence of single cells beneath the basal lamina of the
tibialis anticus of the frog (Mauro 1961 ). Due to their peripheral location, beneath
the basal lamina, he designated these cells satellite cells. Mauro suggested that these
cells were quiescent, non-fused myoblasts (muscle cells) that were present to provide
a resident cell pool capable of facilitating growth and repair, following damage.
Although frequently overlooked, Bernard Katz (Katz 1961 ) also reported the pres-
ence of satellite cells on the periphery of frog muscle spindles in the same month of
the same year. He speculated that these cells were associated with muscle hypertro-
phy. The role of the satellite cell in enabling growth and repair of mature muscle
fibres has gained significant interest, particularly in relation to protein turnover and
cell turnover in muscle adaptation to ageing and disease (Pallafacchina et al. 2013 ).

###### Potential of Satellite Cell Models

Muscle cells retain a memory of the donor environment from which they were
derived such as from cachectic, physically active, sarcopenic, or obese individuals
(reviewed in Sharples et al. 2016 , 2018). Therefore, the study of such satellite cells,
obtained from bioptic samples, provides a relevant understanding of their in vivo
behaviour. Since these cells provide the opportunity for detailed temporal studies to
be performed, they enable research, ethically not possible in vivo, due to the number
of biopsies that would need to be harvested. Satellite cells, therefore, provide
relevant in vitro models and biopsies a snapshot in time, which if paired, provide
an opportunity to monitor in vitro cellular and in vivo physiological/biochemical
adaptation in response to exercise and nutrition, age, disease, disuse and injury.
Damaging protocols, loading, electrical stimulation or serial passaging of the cells
in vitro, also provide relevant models for the study of injury, hypertrophy and
atrophy, which can all be manipulated with, e.g. growth factors, cytokines,
nutraceuticals, or serum; providing knowledge, not only of mechanisms underpin-
ning adaptation, but also the capacity to better inform in vivo questions.
One area of research, which is gaining particular interest in the muscle biology
arena is the impact of age on muscle mass and strength. Research has focussed on the
processes underlying muscle wasting with ageing (sarcopenia) as well as the poten-
tial benefits of exercise and nutrition in reducing the rates of muscle wasting and
therefore improving functional ability and health, with age. Research has focussed
on the roles of exercise and nutrition, with an emphasis on protein (Hesketh et al.
2020 ; Stansfield et al. 2021 ) and cellular turnover (Pallafacchina et al. 2013 ). With
that in mind, it begs the question, what do we know about skeletal muscle ageing?

###### Skeletal Muscle Ageing

As we age, we see a progressive decline in muscle mass, strength, performance and
metabolic potential (Cruz-Jentoft et al. 2018 ; Daily and Park 2022 ). Losses of


14 Ageing Skeletal Muscle: The Ubiquitous Muscle Stem Cell 371

muscle mass associated with ageing are referred to as sarcopenia, whereas those
more accelerated losses, associated with chronic catabolic diseases, are referred to as
cachexia (Saini et al. 2006 ). For the purposes of this manuscript, the focus will be on
muscle wasting with ageing, which can be further sub-categorised into lean or obese
sarcopenia, dependent on the adipose burden of the individual (Molino et al. 2016 ).
Losses of muscle mass and strength with ageing are affected by processes that
influence the balance between anabolism (protein synthesis) and catabolism (protein
degradation) of muscle. The mechanisms of action of these factors are of fundamen-
tal biomedical interest, due to the risk of increased morbidity and early mortality
associated with sarcopenia (Roubenoff 2003 ). It is estimated that we lose approxi-
mately 30–40% of our muscle mass and strength between the ages of 20 and 70 years
and that most individuals aged 80 years or over suffer from sarcopenia; recent
systematic reviews conducted to estimate the prevalence of sarcopenia in older
populations, estimate prevalence to vary between 10 and 40%, depending on
definitions used (Shafiee et al. 2017 ; Mayhew et al. 2018 ). The highest prevalence
estimates were for measures using appendicular lean mass/weight as a defining
factor (Mayhew et al. 2018 ). Given the current ageing demographic, the impact of
sarcopenia not only on the quality of life of the older person but also on the
workforce and the healthcare system warrants consideration. Indeed, a recent retro-
spective, prevalence based, economic burden study, consisting of 4011 adults aged
≥40 years with and without sarcopenia suggested that the total estimated US cost of
hospitalisations in individuals with sarcopenia was $40.4 billion (Goates et al. 2019 ),
making sarcopeniaand itsassociated health complications a major healthcare issue.
Cross sectional studies suggest the main source of musclefibre loss with ageing is
type II musclefibres (Larsson et al. 2019 ). Importantly, with the loss of muscle
fibres, there is also a decline in the abundance of satellite cells with age (Gibson and
Schultz 1983 ; Chen and Goldhamer2003). The role of the satellite cell in enabling
growth and repair of skeletal muscle, across the lifecourse, must therefore be
considered, when trying to determine the role of the satellite cell in delaying or
reducing muscle mass with ageing. Gaining a better understanding of the ageing
muscle stem cell (muscle stem cell and satellite cell are used interchangeably for the
remainder of this chapter) is therefore critical to the development of future interven-
tions targeted at reducing muscle loss with age.

###### Ageing and the Skeletal Muscle Stem Cell

Skeletal muscle growth and regeneration are facilitated by the resident pool of stem
cells in mature musclefibres. Following resistance training or injury and in response
to local (niche), intrinsic (cell) or systemic factors, these muscle stem cells are
activated, divide, migrate to the site of injury and fuse with the damagedfibre to
repair the damaged tissue (McKinnell et al. 2005 ; Fu et al. 2015 ). In addition to
activation and repair, the muscle stem cells have the required capacity to self-renew.
This may occur via asymmetric division, resulting in a differentiation-committed and


372 C. E. Stewart

a non-committed stem cell, the latter enabling replenishment of the resident muscle
stem cell pool (Kuang et al. 2007 ). Symmetric division also occurs to increase the
number of resident muscle stem cells that may be required to repair injury/rebuild a
damagedfibre (Kuang et al. 2007 ). It has recently been reported that the resident
satellite cells form a heterogenous pool, and whether they self-renew or they
differentiate is dictated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors (Sousa-Victor et al. 2022 ).
It is hypothesised that as we age, the number of muscle stem cells declines as does
their potential to repair damage/elicit hypertrophy (although this is still under
debate). Regardless, the mechanisms underpinning muscle wasting and the influence
they have on muscle atrophy, hypertrophy and repair, warrant further investigation.
While it is not clear whether reduced muscle stem cell activity/numbers are the
cause or the result of ageing muscle, what is clear is that the processes are more
complex than altered cellular behaviour alone. As alluded to above, the stem cell
niche (extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors,fibroblasts, immune cells,
neurones and capillaries) as well as autocrine, paracrine and endocrine adaptations
with age, all contribute to the altered behaviour of the muscle stem cell and to
declining muscle mass (for recent and extensive reviews see Almada and Wagers
(2016)); Hong et al. ( 2022 ); Sahinyan et al. ( 2022 )). One area gaining extensive
interest in ageing and in ageing muscle stem cell behaviour, in particular, is the role
of cell senescence in altered muscle stem cell behaviour and in sarcopenia (Almada
and Wagers 2016 ; He et al. 2022 ). Recent data suggest that the ability of older
satellite cells to engraft, following intramuscular transplantation into immunocom-
promised mice, is reduced compared to younger cells, in a cell-density-dependent
manner (Cosgrove et al. 2014 ). The older donor cells displayed reduced replicative
capacity, increased p38α/β-MAPK activation and elevated levels of senescence
regulator genes, thought to be involved in the reduced proliferative capacity of the
aged cells (Cosgrove et al. 2014 ) and with the downstream elevation of the cyclin-
dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK 4a (Muñoz-Espín and Serrano 2014 ).
While the above mechanisms begin to provide insight into what is happening to
the ageing satellite cell, what they do not cover is the influence of lifecourse
epigenetic adaptation, which also occurs with ageing and the impact this may have
on stem cell behaviour and muscle adaptation with ageing.

###### Ageing, Epigenetics and Skeletal Muscle

DNA modifications, without changes to the DNA sequence itself, enable rapid
cellular adaptation to environmental/behavioural situations. A fundamental hallmark
of the ageing process is an altered epigenetic landscape reportedly responsible for
altered metabolism, poorly regulated mitochondrial function, cellular senescence,
stem cell reductions and altered intracellular signalling (López-Otín et al. 2013 ;
Voisin et al. 2020 ). DNA methylation with ageing is reportedly a key feature of the
ageing process in many tissues. The comparative study of younger (n=24 healthy
young males; age range 18–27) vs. older (n=24 healthy aged males; age range


14 Ageing Skeletal Muscle: The Ubiquitous Muscle Stem Cell 373

68 – 89 years) skeletal muscle samples using DNA methylation arrays (covering
450,000 CpG sites) revealed a hypermethylated pattern across the genome in
older, compared to younger human muscle (Zykovich et al. 2014 ). It is speculated
that the methylation changes in muscle, with ageing may underpin the sarcopenic
adaptation, also witnessed, however, it is important to note that the majority of the
hypermethylated sites were within the genes themselves, rather than within their
promotor regions. That being said, the authors did successfully sub-classify the
tissue correctly into young and old categories based on 500 of the CpG sites and
were thefirst to report an epigenetic signature of ageing muscle (Zykovich et al.
2014 ). Subsequent studies have suggested that the methylation status of approxi-
mately 200 CpG sites can accurately predict the chronological age of skeletal muscle
tissue (Voisin et al. 2020 ; Voisin et al. 2021 ).
Research from the group of Sharples, using technology allowing investigation of
850,000 CpG sites in skeletal muscle tissue and skeletal muscle-derived stem cells,
also revealed an accumulation of hypermethylated sites in both muscle tissue and
isolated muscle-derived stem cells from aged (mean 83 years) versus young (mean
27 years) adults (Turner et al. 2020 ). The methylation profile in aged tissue was
associated with enriched hypermethylation in load/growth-associated gene pathways
such as focal adhesion and mTORC signalling, as well as pathways-in-cancer
(including focal adhesion, MAPK signalling, PI3K-Akt-mTOR signalling, p53
signalling, Jak-STAT signalling and TGF-beta and notch signalling), rap1-
signalling, axon-guidance and hippo-signalling (Turner et al. 2020 ). The
hypermethylation profile of aged muscle stem cells displayed enrichment in genes
associated with axon-guidance, adherens junction and calcium signalling, particu-
larly at later timepoints of myotube formation, where morphological differentiation
was compromised in aged vs. young cells and reductions in MyoD/Myogenin gene
expression were evident (Turner et al. 2020 ). Like the research of Zykovich et al.
(2014), we also reported that genes involved in axon guidance, in both aged tissue
and isolated muscle cells, displayed enriched hypermethylation compared with their
younger adult counterparts (Turner et al. 2020 ).
Epigenetic adaptation regulates gene expression, by making the DNA conducive
(euchromatin) or non-conducive (heterochromatin) to transcription. Increased DNA
methylation, as evident with ageing, generally results in a reduction in transcription,
suggesting that gene transcription in muscle and muscle-derived stem cells declines
with ageing. These changes may contribute to impaired muscle function and fusion
with ageing. Further studies in other models do suggest an important role for
epigenetics in ageing. Studies investigating transposase-accessible chromatin using
sequencing (ATAC-seq) of old and young murine muscle stem cells also revealed
extensive differences in chromatin accessibility in aged vs young cells (Shcherbina
et al. 2020 ). Further, a general loss of heterochromatin with ageing has also been
described in numerous model organisms and many adult stem cells, which is thought
to culminate in inappropriate gene expression profiles and cell behaviour (for details
see Sahinyan et al. ( 2022 )). While the focus here has been on altered epigenetic
patterns in muscle and muscle stem cells, it is important to remember that DNA
damage, absence/presence of senescence, inappropriate signalling and metabolism,


374 C. E. Stewart

mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy and the increased abundance of
damaged proteins, all contribute to the changes cells and tissues experience with
ageing (for reviews see Voisin et al. ( 2021 ); Hong et al. ( 2022 ); Sahinyan et al.
(2022)). A recent review examining the role of myofibre repair vs. stem cell-driven
regeneration begins to interrogate why repair and regeneration are impaired in
sarcopenia and raises interesting questions for future research in the study of the
mechanisms underpinning muscle wasting with ageing (Roman and Muñoz-
Cánoves 2022 ).

###### Summary

Skeletal muscle wasting with ageing is known to impact not only function, metab-
olism, quality of life and falls risk, but also impacts compromised cardiovascular
health, increased general rates of morbidity and early mortality. While exercise and
nutrition are known to reduce the rate of muscle loss, even master’s athletes do lose
muscle mass, indicating an element of anabolic resistance with ageing. Extensive
research exists, but more is needed in this arena. However, if we do not fully
understand the cause of muscle loss (in the face of healthy nutrition and continued
activity), then the likelihood of success for interventions will be compromised. The
questions now being addressed relating to lifecourse influences on epigenetic pro-
files in muscle with age, thefluidity of such profiles and the potential distinctions
betweenfibre-driven self-repair vs. satellite cell-mediated regeneration with age
pose interesting research questions. Ultimately understanding if ageing drives
compromised muscle function, or if compromised function culminates in ageing is
an interesting concept remaining to be defined.

Sara Fidalgo and Mark S. Yeoman

Abstract Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is an important neurotransmit-
terin the central nervous system and the periphery. Most 5-HT (~99%) is found in
the periphery where it regulates the function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and is
an important regulator of platelet aggregation. However, the remaining 1% that is
found in the central nervous system (CNS) can regulate a range of physiological
processes such as learning and memory formation, mood, food intake, sleep, tem-
perature and pain perception. More recent work on the CNS of invertebrate model
systems has shown that 5-HT can directly regulate lifespan.
This chapter will focus on detailing how CNS 5-HT signalling is altered with
increasing age and the potential consequences this has on its ability to regulate
lifespan.

###### Overview of 5-HT in the Central Nervous System

###### Discovery of 5-HT

5-HT was originally isolated from the GI tract by Vittorio Espamer as a substance
that was able to contract a range of smooth muscles (Erspamer and Vialli, 1937 ). He
namedthe substance enteramine. A little later a substance called serotonin was

isolated and named by Rapport, Green and Page of the Cleveland Clinic in 1948 and
enteramine and serotonin were shown to be the same molecule (Rapport et al.
1948a, b) and later identified as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (Rapport, 1949 ). In
the early 1950s, Twarog published a paper that was thefirst to show that 5-HT was a
neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain (Twarog and Page, 1953 ). Thisfinding has
led to the development of a range of drugs to treat a range of mental health
conditions.

###### 5-HT Distribution in the CNS

5-HT is present in relatively few neurons in the CNS that have their cell bodies
located in a region of the CNS called the pons and the medulla in several nuclei
called the raphe nuclei (Fig.15.1). Despite the relatively low numbers of CNS
serotonergic neurons, their processes are widespread and input into many regions
of the brain (Fig.15.1). This allows 5-HT to regulate a wide range of physiological
processes detailed above. Serotonergic neuronal cell bodies originating from the
midbrain region (B1, B2 and B3) have descending projections in the spinal cord
allowing them to regulate pain perception, motor function and the autonomic
nervous system (Fig.15.1B). B6 and B7 make up the principal dorsal raphe group
which projects to the cortex where they regulate sleep, the dorsal striatum where they
influence motor control and the amygdala where they can affect mood. B5, B8 and
B9 which form the median raphe nuclei project to cortex and hippocampus where
they regulate learning and memory formation. Serotonergic projections are also
found in the hypothalamus, where they have been shown to affect circadian rhythm,
food intake and thermoregulation, and the thalamus where they have a role in sleep
and the regulation of epileptic activity.

###### 5-HT Synthesis

5-HT is synthesised from the precursor amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan is
an essential amino acid derived from proteins in the diet. It is taken up into neurons
by a range of different transporters (Vumma et al. 2011 ). Here it is converted
to 5-hydroxytryptophan by the rate-limiting enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase
(TpH). There are two isoforms of TpH in mammals. Of these TpH-2 is located in
neurons and is responsible for the hydroxylation of tryptophan in the CNS. Subse-
quent decarboxylation by a non-specific amino acid decarboxylase forms
5-hydroxyryptamine (Fig.15.2, lower panel). 5-HT is then packaged into vesicles
by the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) prior to release. Increases in
intracellular Ca2+, typically caused by the arrival of an action potential at the
presynaptic terminal, act as a stimulus to allow the vesicles to fuse with the plasma
membrane allowing them to release some or all of their contents into the synapse. To
limit 5-HT signalling, 5-HT is taken back up into neurons via the actions of the
serotonin transporter (SERT) where it can be re-packaged into vesicles or
metabolised by monoamine oxidase. There are two monoamine oxidase (MAO)
enzymes in the nervous system, termed A and B. MAOApreferentially metabolises
5-HT, however, monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) is the major monoamine oxidase in
5-HT-containing neurons but its affinity for 5-HT is low (O’Carroll et al. 1983 ), and
therefore whilst it may deaminate some 5-HT most will be re-packaged into vesicles

synthesis and metabolism of 5-hydroxytryptamine (below). Adapted from (Millan et al.2008)


382 S. Fidalgo and M. S. Yeoman

to be used again for synaptic signalling. MAOAhas also been shown to be expressed
in glial cells (Westlund et al. 1988 ; Fitzgerald et al. 1990 ) and has been shown to be
functionally active (Fitzgerald et al. 1990 ). In addition, human astrocytes express
SERT mRNA (Kubota et al. 2001 ) and 5-HT uptake into astrocytes has been
demonstrated (Bel et al. 1997 ; Hirst et al. 1998 ; Malynn et al. 2013 ). Therefore,
glial uptake and metabolism could also contribute to the removal of 5-HT from the
synapse. In addition to SERT other transporters such as the organic cation trans-
porter 3 can transport 5-HT into neurons and glial cells (Takeda et al. 2002 ; Vialou
et al. 2008 ; Gasser et al. 2009 ), whilst the plasma membrane monoamine transporter
(Dahlin et al. 2007 ), allows re-uptake of 5-HT in both serotonergic and
non-serotonergic neurons. Following deamination to 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde
an aldehyde dehydrogenase converts this product to 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid,
which being water soluble, can then be excreted in the urine (Fig.15.2).

###### 5-HT Receptors

5-HT has its actions via seven different receptor types classed as 5-HT 1 – 5-HT 7
receptors. 5-HT 1 , 5-HT 2 , 5-HT 4 , 5-HT 5 , 5-HT 6 and 5-HT 7 are all G-protein-coupled
receptors. 5-HT 1 receptors reduce intracellular cAMP whilst 5-HT4,5,6 and 7receptors
all increase intracellular cAMP (Alexander et al. 2011 ). 5-HT 2 receptors act via Gq
to increase intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C. 5-HT 3 receptors are
ionotropic receptors with an integral ion channel that transduces the binding of
extracellular 5-HT into a depolarisation of the target cell. Within each class of
receptors, there are a range of sub-types of 5-HT receptors making a total of
14 different 5-HT receptors through which 5-HT can have its actions on other
neurons, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes within the CNS (Alexander
et al. 2011 ). Inhibitory 5-HT1A/Bautoreceptors can inhibit thefiring rate of seroto-
nergic neurons and therefore reduce 5-HT release (Fig.15.2).

###### Effects of Age on Serotonergic Signalling

Given the ability of 5-HT to regulate a range of behaviours that have been shown to
be affected by the natural ageing process (e.g. learning and memory, sleep and
mood) research has focused on whether age-related changes in serotonergic signal-
ling can help explain these deficits. In the next section, we will describe how the
natural ageing process affects the different elements involved in regulating seroto-
nergic signalling in the CNS.

###### Effects of Age on Serotonergic Neuronal Number

A landmark study in 1997 by Morrison and Hof quantified the numbers of neurons in
the ageing neocortex and hippocampus and showed limited neuronal death that was
unlikely to lead to the losses in function observed in older people (Morrison and Hof,
1997 ). A more focused study of the ageing raphe nuclei in humans has shown that
the numbers of serotonergic neurons are not significantly altered by the ageing
process (Klöppel et al. 2001 ). Interestingly, similar studies in non-human primates
showed a decrease in cell packing density and neuronal number in aged rhesus
monkeys (Kemper et al. 1997 ). However, in this study, the phenotype of the neurons
was not determined, although the authors believed that at least one of the populations
that were decreased in number was serotonergic, based on their size (Kemper et al.
1997 ). A similar age-related decrease in the density of 5-HT-positive neuronal cell
bodies was observed in the raphe of the rat (Lolova and Davidoff, 1992 ). In the
absence of a loss in neuronal cell bodies, an imaging study in humans has demon-
strated a loss offibres in the raphe—hippocampal tract, inferring some peripheral
neurodegeneration (Sekul and Ikuta, 2021 ). A similar reduction in the innervation of
the neocortex from the raphe has also been observed in aged rats (Descarries et al.
1975 ).
These data suggest that the natural ageing process either reduces the numbers of
connections that the serotonergic neurons are making with their target or decreases
the numbers of serotonergic neurons. Which of these effects is observed is probably
reflective of the biological age of the subjects, with younger subjects showing milder
neuronal process degeneration, whilst older subjects may experience some neuronal
loss. Whether these changes are sufficient to impair the functioning of the CNS is
unclear, although in at least one study correlations were observed between loss of
neurons and memory function (Kemper et al. 1997 ).

###### Tryptophan Hydroxylase

Tryptophan Hydroxylase (TpH) activity and CNS expression has been explored in a
range of organisms from snails and mice to humans. In general, the activity of TpH2
was found to decrease with increasing age in snails (Morgan et al. 2021 ) and rats
(Hussain and Mitra, 2000 ; Hussain and Mitra, 2004 ) in a range of CNS regions.
Immunohistochemical analysis of TpH2 expression in the rat neural and
neurointermediate lobes of the pituitary showed reduced labelling with increased
age, suggesting a decrease in TpH2 protein expression (Saland et al. 1993 ). How-
ever, other studies using immunohistochemistry failed to show any change in the
expression of TpH2 in SAMP8 mice (Pérez-Cáceres et al. 2013 ), rats (Timiras et al.
1984 ) or in humans (Klöppel et al. 2001 ).
Work by Hussain and Mitra strongly suggested that the decrease in TpH2 activity
was due to age-related decreases in the expression of key antioxidant enzymes. This


384 S. Fidalgo and M. S. Yeoman

would increase oxidative stress and reduce TpH2 activity, an effect that was blocked
by catalase and/or glutathione peroxidase. They also suggested that the phosphory-
lation status of TpH 2 was also a possible site of the age-related decline in TpH2
activity but did not show any evidence to support this hypothesis (Hussain and
Mitra, 2000 ; Hussain and Mitra, 2004 ). Our work on the snail has shown that 14-3-3,
a protein known to facilitate TpH-2 phosphorylation, is downregulated with increas-
ing age and this downregulation could explain the reduced activity of TpH in the
CNS (Morgan et al. 2021 ). Interestingly, whilst a regional analysis confirmed that
TpH activity was decreased in old snails, analysis at the level of a single identifiable
serotonergic neuron showed that 5-HT expression increased with increasing age.
These data strongly suggest that analysis at the level of the single neuron is required
to provide a complete picture of how 5-HT synthesis is affected by the ageing
process.

###### Vesicular 5-HT Content

5-HT is synthesised in the cytoplasm and transported into vesicles by the vesicular
monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). An imaging study in rats showed no change in
the expression of VMAT2 with increasing age but showed a change in the subcel-
lular localisation of the protein, which correlated with age-related decreases in
function (Cruz-Muros et al. 2009 ). Consistent with thisfinding, an imaging study
in humans demonstrated a small decrease in VMAT2 function of 0.77% per annum
(Frey et al. 1996 ), whilst another showed no significant change in VMAT2 function
(Lin et al. 2013 ). Together these studies strongly suggest that vesicular neurotrans-
mitter content is unlikely to change significantly with increasing age.

###### 5-Hydroxytryptamine

Invertebrates lend themselves to the study of ageing due to their relatively short
lifespans. In the nematode wormC. elegans, immunohistochemical methods dem-
onstrated that CNS 5-HT decreased with increasing age (Yin et al. 2014 ). Similar
decreases were observed inDrosophila(Liao et al. 2017 ). In the pond snail,
Lymnaea, there was no significant change in regional 5-HT with increasing age
(Yeoman et al. 2008 ; Morgan et al. 2021 ), however, HPLC analysis at single cell
level showed that somatic 5-HT was increased in a key identified neuron, the
cerebral giant cell (CGC) responsible for learning and memory formation (Morgan
et al. 2021 ). Using immunohistochemistry with a secondaryfluorescent antibody, we
have confirmed the HPLCfindings as 5-HTfluorescence was also more intense in
the old CGC somata (Fig.15.3, lower panels). However, 5-HTfluorescence in the
terminals (buccal ganglia) is reduced with increasing age, indicating that the

young, middle-aged and old CNSs

subcellular distribution of 5-HT changes with increasing age (Yeoman unpublished
data; Fig.15.3).
In mammals, despite the potential for age to decrease the activity of TpH2, many
studies exploring the impact of the natural ageing process on CNS 5-HT production
did not show a decrease in CNS 5-HT in humans (Robinson, 1975 ; Rosa-Neto et al.
2007 ) and rodents (Bhaskaran and Radha, 1983 ; Moretti et al. 1987 ; Sparks et al.
1985 ; Venero et al.1991a, b; Venero et al.1993a) across a range of CNS regions. A
number of these studies by Venero and colleagues explored age-related changes in
5-HT in a range of different CNS regions. They showed either no change in 5-HT
expression in the striatum and substantia nigra (Venero et al.1991a, b), increases in
the hippocampus (Venero et al.1993a) or decreases in the pre-frontal cortex (Venero
et al.1993b) in 26-month-old rats compared to young controls, illustrating that the
changes were brain region specific. Consistent with the decrease seen in the
pre-frontal cortex, similar decreases were observed in 22 months (Petkov et al.
1988 ) and 24 months (Míguez et al. 1999 ) old rat cortex when compared to mature
adult rats. However, similar changes were not seen in other rat studies or in humans
and in one study an increase in rat cortical 5-HT was observed at ages greater than
30 months (Timiras et al. 1984 ). Whilst many studies infer that CNS 5-HT does not
change with increasing age, publications that demonstrate decreases or increases in
regional 5-HT infer that the direction of effect could be related to subject age and in


386 S. Fidalgo and M. S. Yeoman

the case of rats, the strain studied and the housing conditions all of which could
affect the rate of ageing (Jackson et al. 2017 ).

###### Firing of Serotonergic Neurones

Many aged neurons show reduced spontaneous and evokedfiring frequencies when
compared to young controls (Yeoman et al. 2012 ). In a range of species, these
changes reflect increases in intracellular calcium and the activation of one of more
calcium-dependent potassium currents and an increase in the amplitude and duration
of the after-depolarisation that follows the action potential (for reviewseeYeoman
et al. 2012 ). Studies in the mouse raphe nuclei demonstrated that raphe neuronsfire
tonically with a very low coefficient of variation and those recorded from old mice
fire at a lower frequency and are sometimes silent. An increased after-spike current
that corresponds to the after-hyperpolarisation was observed in aged raphe neurons
consistent withfindings in other central neurons (Rood et al. 2014 ). Work using the
pond snail has also shown that the identified serotonergic CGC alsofires tonically
and its spontaneous and evokedfiring frequency is reduced with increasing age due
to the appearance of a large after-hyperpolarisation caused in part by increased
currentflow through a slow Ca2+-dependant potassium current (Scutt et al. 2015 ).
Therefore, even in the absence of any regional change in CNS 5-HT the reduced
firing rate of serotonergic neurons would tend to infer that less 5-HT is being
released into the synapse, potentially impacting the efficacy of transmission.

###### Release of 5-HT

The effects of age on neuronal 5-HT release have been little studied. Our work has
explored this in the pond snail,Lymnaea(Patel et al. 2010 ). Using carbonfibre
electrodes, we utilised constant potential amperometry to measure the dynamics of
release events that represent the binding of individual neurotransmitter vesicles with
the membrane and the subsequent release of the neurotransmitter 5-HT. The tech-
nique relies on holding the tip of the carbonfibre at a constant potential (+750 mV)
that allows for the complete oxidation of the released molecules of 5-HT. The
oxidation of these molecules is monitored as theflow of electrons to the electrode
and the subsequent current can be monitored. Release events are fast to rise and have
a slower fall time. Their amplitude and duration are variable, and this reflects a
combination of the size of the vesicle that fuses with the presynaptic membrane and
the proportion of transmitter released from that vesicle. The size of the current is
directly proportional to the number of molecules of 5-HT released according to the
Faraday Law. Analysis of 5-HT release from the serotonergic CGCs showed that
ageing increased the number of molecules of 5-HT released per release event
(Fig.15.4A) by increasing the time constant for decay of the events (Fig.15.4B).

neuron in the pond snail,Lymnaea. Effects of age on (A) the number of molecules released per
event and (B) the time constant for decay of each event (Patel et al. 2010 )

These age-related changes are unlikely to reflect an increase in CGC vesicular 5-HT
concentration as previous studies have shown either no change or a decrease in
VMAT2 expression with ageing (Scutt et al. 2015 ). The precise causes of these
changes are currently unclear, but they could be due to age-related changes in
intracellular Ca2+that have previously been described in these neurons (Scutt et al.
2015 ) and/or altered membrane lipid composition which has the potential to change
the dynamics of vesicular release (Gu et al. 2020 ). In support of this hypothesis,
changes in membrane lipid composition have previously been observed in the ageing
CNS (Egawa et al. 2016 ). Fewer release events were observed in old neurons raising
the possibility that the increase in release per event was a compensatory mechanism
by the neuron to maintain levels of 5-HT in the synapse given the reduced frequency
of action potentialfiring. Previous work exploring glutamatergic synapses has
shown that the dynamics of release can have a marked impact on signalling, with
multiple low-level stimuli, as might be observed in a young neuron, having mark-
edly different postsynaptic effects to fewer larger stimuli that would represent
signalling in old neurons. Thus, changes in the release kinetics at serotonergic
synapses could impact the efficacy of synaptic transmission.

###### Age-Related Changes in 5-HT Clearance from the Synapse

5-HT can be cleared from the synapse by diffusion or re-uptake into neurons/glial
cells via the action of SERT. A wide range of studies have explored the effects of age
on SERT expression in humans and several rodent species. In living humans and
non-human primates, imaging studies have been performed using single photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography

(PET). These studies used a range of radiolabelled ligands for SERT to measure
uptake via SERT and consistently showed that CNS SERT was downregulated with
increasing age (van Dyck et al. 2000 ; Kakiuchi et al. 2001 ; Kuikka et al. 2001 ; Hesse
etal. 2003; Koch et al. 2014 ; Yamamoto et al. 2002 ; Fazio et al. 2016 ). In
non-human primates, similar decreases in SERT activity were observed with increas-
ing age (Kakiuchi et al. 2001 ). More recently, Karrer and colleagues (Karrer et al.
2019 ) performed a meta-analysis of human PET and SPECT studies and showed a
moderate decrease in human CNS SERT with increasing age (Table15.1). This
decrease would again act to increase 5-HT in the synapse and therefore help to
compensate for the decreasedfiring rate observed in serotonergic neurons with
increasing age.
Contrary to the imaging studies, when SERT expression was explored in post-
mortemhuman brain tissue the effects of age were less conclusive. Studies showed
either a decrease (Marcusson et al. 1987 ), no change (Andersson et al. 1992 ; Arranz
etal. 1993; Ryding et al. 2004 ), or an increase in SERT expression in several brain
regions (Severson et al. 1985 ). Unlike the in vivo imaging studies that measured
SERTactivity, these post-mortem studies explored the expression of SERT and the
different techniques may explain these discrepancies.
In rodent studies, the effects of age on SERT expression are more complicated. In
the majority of the papers cited below, studies explored post-mortem brain tissues
and therefore explored the expression of SERT and not its activity. Many studies
showed increases in SERT expression with increasing age in a range of CNS regions
including the cortex (Brunello et al. 1988 ; Druse et al. 1997 ; Severson, 1986 ), raphe
nucleus (Meister et al. 1995 ), nucleus accumbens (Druse et al. 1997 ), amygdala
(Druse et al. 1997 ), hippocampus (Druse et al. 1997 , Severson, 1986 ) and the


15 Age-Related Changes in Central Nervous System 5-Hydroxytryptamine... 389

hypothalamus (Severson, 1986 ). In some studies, increased SERT expression was
observed between young and adult rodents and this was followed by a decreased
expression in old age. In the hippocampus, SERT expression (measured by parox-
etine binding) was increased in 15-month-old Fisher 344 rats and decreased in
24-month-old animals (Arora et al. 1993 ). Similarly, in hamsters, SERT binding
was increased in middle-aged animals (Duncan et al. 2000 ) and decreased in old age
(Duncan and Hensler, 2002 ).
These discrepancies between the human and animal studies most likely reflect the
different methods for analysing the effects of age on SERT, but it could infer that the
effects of age on SERT are different in rodents and humans. To test this latter
hypothesis several studies have attempted to measure SERT function in aged
rodents. In one such study, SERT function was assessed by using micro-PET to
mimic the human in vivo studies (Hoekzema et al. 2011 ). The authors compared
4 months with 19-months-old male OFA rats and demonstrated that ageing was
associated with an increase in SERT activity in the frontal cortex and the thalamus/
midbrain of the rat (Fig.15.5). This strongly suggested that the effects of age on
SERT function were different in rodents and humans. However, another study that
explored cortical 5-HT uptake in 24-month-old male Sprague Dawley rats, showed a
decrease in aged rats, consistent with the human studies (Brunello et al. 1988 ).
Additionally, in the same study the authors showed that expression, measured by
imipramine and paroxetine binding was increased with age, strongly suggesting that
whilst the expression of SERT may increase with increasing age its function is
decreased. The differences in thefindings of these two studies may be reflective of
the strain or age of the rats used and highlight the necessity for further studies using
imaging techniques in other strains of rats over a range of age groups to more fully
explore the timeline of changes in SERT expression and activity in aged rodents.
Our work using the pond snail as a model system for exploring the effects of age
on serotonergic signalling explored the ability of the selective 5-HT re-uptake
inhibitor to affect the strength of the monosynaptic connection between the seroto-
nergic CGC neuron and the B1 motor neuron. In this study, single action potentials
were evoked in the CGC and the corresponding excitatory post-synaptic potential
(EPSP) was recorded intracellularly in a B1 motor neuron. In young (3–4 months)
and middle-aged (6–7 months old) snails, the amplitude and the duration of the
EPSP was enhanced dramatically in the presence offluoxetine, consistent with it
blocking the re-uptake of 5-HT and enhancing the concentration of 5-HT in the
synapse. In old (11–12 months) snails, the control EPSP was not significantly
enhanced byfluoxetine consistent with a decrease in either the expression or activity
of SERT with increasing age (Yeoman et al. 2008 ).

###### Effects of Age on Monoamine Oxidase A/B

There are two isoforms of monoamine oxidase, namely MAOAand MAOBencoded
by different genes (Weyler et al. 1990 ). Their role is to deaminate and thereby

inactivate monoamines such as norepinephrine, dopamine and 5-HT. MAOAis the
main isoform that degrades 5-HT and is predominantly located in astrocytes within
the CNS (Fowler and Tipton, 1984 ). MAOBis expressed in serotonergic neurons
(Jahng et al. 1997 ; Kitahama et al. 1991 ; Luque et al. 1995 ), but its affinity for 5-HT
is very low and therefore whether it significantly affects intracellular 5-HT or
whether its presence is to deactivate other monoamines that may be brought into
the cell by SERT is not known. A wide range of studies have explored how the


15 Age-Related Changes in Central Nervous System 5-Hydroxytryptamine... 391

ageing process affects the expression/activity of MAOA. Whilst a few studies have
shown that ageing is associated with an increase in MAOAexpression or activity
(Shih, 1979 ; Petkov et al. 1988 , Pradhan 1980 ), most studies showed no significant
change in MAOAactivity or expression with increasing age in humans (Carlsson
et al. 1981 ; Gottfries et al. 1975 ; Fowler et al.1980a, b; Kornhuber et al. 1989 ;
Sparks et al. 1991 ; Volchegorskii et al. 2001 ), the squirrel monkey (Irwin et al. 1997 )
or the rat (Timiras et al. 1984 , Sparks et al. 1985 ). Despite the lack of change in
MAOAa number of studies have shown changes in a measure of 5-HT turnover,
namely the 5-HIAA:5-HT ratio (Lee et al. 2001 ; Sparks et al. 1985 ; Venero et al.
1993b). These changes may be reflective of the observed increase in MAOBexpres-
sion and activity seen with increased age in humans (Carlsson et al. 1981 ; Gottfries
et al. 1975 ; Fowler et al.1980a, b; Kornhuber et al. 1989 ; Sparks et al. 1991 ;
Volchegorskii et al. 2001 ; Fowler et al. 1997 ) and rodents (Benedetti and Keane,
1980 ; Arai and Kinemuchi, 1988 ; Venero et al.1993a; Irwin et al. 1992 ; Pardon et al.
2000 ; Saura et al. 1994 ). Additionally, they could represent increased metabolism by
astrocytes/glial cells facilitated by impaired neuronal re-uptake of 5-HT in the
synapse (see previous section). Further studies are required to clarify the causes of
these changes in the absence of any significant change in MAOA.

###### Effects of Age on 5-HT Receptors

5-HT receptors can be subdivided into seven main classes many of which have
additional sub-types yielding a total of 14 different receptor types. Changes in the
expression of any of these receptors could have profound effects on 5-HT signalling,
both in neurons and in glial cells within the CNS.

5-HT1AReceptors

5-HT1Areceptors act as autoreceptors inhibiting the release of 5-HT from seroto-
nergic neurons. In addition, they can also act as heteroreceptors regulating the
release of transmitters from non-serotonergic neurons. Inhibitory 5-HT1Areceptors
have been linked with regulation of long-term memory and the sleep/wake cycle,
both of which can be disrupted in older humans (Gaspar et al. 2003 ; Hannon and
Hoyer, 2008 ). Imaging studies in humans have shown changes in 5-HT1Areceptor
binding in a range of brain regions (Parsey et al. 2002 ; Moses-Kolko et al. 2011 ;
Rabiner et al. 2002 ; Costes et al. 2005 ; Møller et al. 2007 ; Tauscher et al. 2001 ; Cidis
Meltzer et al. 2001 ; Drevets et al. 1999 ). A meta-analysis of these studies has been
recently published by Karrer and colleagues and demonstrated that increasing age
decreased the expression of 5-HT1Areceptors by between 1.5% and 7.0% per decade
depending on the brain region examined (Karrer et al. 2019 ) (Table15.2).
Similar age-related decreases in 5-HT1Areceptors have been observed using PET
scanning in the frontal and temporal cortices of aged non-human primates (Tsukada

et al. 2001 ). Studies have also shown a decrease in 5-HT1Abinding sites in the brains
of old rats (Nyakas et al. 1997 ) and hamsters (Duncan and Hensler, 2002 ). Other
investigators did notfind any difference in theHtr1agene mRNA level in brains of
young and old rats (Yau et al. 1999 , Mitchell et al. 2009 ). However, the relationship
between this lack of change inHtr1agene mRNA to 5-HT1Areceptor protein
expression is unclear as this was not explored in these studies.

5-HT1BReceptors

Similar to the 5-HT1Areceptor, 5-HT1Breceptors can be located presynaptically
where they act as autoreceptors to regulate 5-HT release (Hoyer and Middlemiss,
1989 ), but they are also present on non-serotonergic neurons where they act as
heteroreceptors regulating neurotransmitter release (Middlemiss and Hutson; 1990 ,
Maura and Raiteri, 1986 ). Relatively few studies have explored how the expression
of the 5-HT1Breceptor is altered with increasing age. In humans, 5-HT1Breceptors
were shown to decrease with increasing age at a rate of approximately 8% per decade
(Matsumoto et al. 2011 ). In rats, ageing caused a decrease in theHtr1bmRNA level
in the brains of old rats compared to young animals (Mitchell et al. 2009 ). These
changes do not appear to be due to neurodegeneration of serotonergic neurons as
there is no change in the expression of 5-HT1Aor 5-HT 6 mRNA in same study.

5-HT2AReceptors

5-HT2Areceptors are located on the post-synaptic neuron and have high concentra-
tions in the cerebral cortex, piriform cortex and entorhinal cortex and are also present
in the basal forebrain, the septal nuclei and in the CA1–3 regions of the hippocampus
and the dentate gyrus. These latter locations relate to the involvement of this receptor
in learning and memory formation. These receptors are also involved in the aetiology
of a range of psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, anxiety and depression
with drugs that alleviate these conditions acting either to reduce 5-HT2Areceptor
expression or directly reduce its activation by endogenous 5-HT (Raote et al. 2007 ).
Imaging studies in humans have shown consistent age-related decreases in
5-HT2Areceptor expression (Iyo and Yamasaki, 1993 ; Frokjaer et al. 2009 ; Véra
et al. 1996 ; Soares et al. 2001 ; Rosell et al. 2010 ; Wong et al. 1987 ; Wong et al.
1984 ; Moses-Kolko et al. 2011 ; Baeken et al. 1998 ; Uchida et al. 2011 ; Blin et al.
1993 ; Blin et al. 1990 ; Sheline et al. 2002 ; Messa et al. 2003 ; Yatham et al. 2000 ). A
meta-analysis of human PET and SPECT studies demonstrated a marked decrease in
5-HT2Areceptor expression with increasing age (Karrer et al. 2019 ) (Table15.3).
These data are unequivocal and are supported by studies in non-human primates in a
range of brain regions (Kakiuchi et al. 2000 ). Studies also report an age-dependent
reduction of 5-HT2Areceptor binding sites in brains of old rats (Gozlan et al. 1990 ;
Druse et al. 1997 ). However, other studies did notfind any difference in theHtr2a

gene mRNA in the brains of young and old rats (Yau et al. 1999 ), or in 5-HT2A
receptor expression (Robson et al. 1993 ; Yamaguchi and Yamagata, 1991 ).
The decrease in 5-HT2Areceptor expression demonstrated by the imaging studies
in humans is convincing and these age-related changes could contribute to the well-
described age-related impairments in learning and memory formation.
Gene sequencing studies in a range of invertebrate species have identified a
number of different 5-HT receptors including 5-HT1, 2, 4, 6 and 7receptors (Tierney,
2020 ). However, to our knowledge there are no studies that have directly explored
how ageing affects the expression of these receptors inC. elegans,Drosophilaor in
molluscsLymnaeaorAplysia. Our work onLymnaeahas shown that signalling
through a cinanserin sensitive (5-HT 2 -like receptor) is inhibited with increasing age,
consistent with the mammalian data (Yeoman et al. 2008 ).

5-HT4, 6 and 7Receptors

5-HT4 and 6receptors have been linked with facilitating learning and memory
formation (Meneses, 2015 ; Branchek and Blackburn, 2000 ). A limited number of
studies have explored the effects of age on the expression of 5-HT 4 (Madsen et al.
2011 ; Lorke et al. 2006 ) and 5-HT 6 (Lorke et al. 2006 ; Radhakrishnan et al. 2018 )
receptors in humans using imaging techniques. In both cases, the expression of the
receptors decreased with increasing age.
No studies have been performed to explore the effects of age on human 5-HT 7
receptor expression but studies in hamsters (Duncan and Franklin, 2007 ) and rats
(Yau et al. 1999 ) showed no change with increasing age.

###### Overview of Effects of Age on Serotonergic Signalling

Under conditions of healthy ageing, several factors appear to be acting to reduce
serotonergic signalling in the CNS with increasing age. These are a reduction in the
numbers of connections that serotonergic neurons make with different regions of the
CNS, a decrease in thefiring frequency of serotonergic neurons and a reduction in
post-synaptic 5-HT1B, 2A, 4 and 6receptors. Several factors appear to act to compen-
sate for these deficits. First, studies inLymnaeashow that ageing increases the
amount of 5-HT released per release event. This would increase synaptic 5-HT and
provide a stronger stimulation of the post-synaptic cell in the presence of reduced
numbers of connections and reduced receptor expression. Second, in humans
decreases in presynaptic autoreceptors, would reduce the brake on transmitter release
and increase the amount of 5-HT in the synapse. Finally, age-related decreases in
SERT function would also act to increase and prolong synaptic 5-HT signalling, by
reducing clearance from the synapse.

NE–not examined

Taken together it is difficult to predict how all these changes might affect
serotonergic signalling. Indeed, variation in the species used, the brain region
examined and animal age adds complexity to the analysis. What is clear is that
with ageing, synaptic 5-HT concentration will be higher and these high levels will be
prolonged compared to the young synapse, due to impaired clearance via SERT. If
this is the case then there is the potential for spill over of the transmitter from the
synapse and activation of extrasynaptic autoreceptors or receptors on other neurons/
glial cells. Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of synaptic 5-HT will also lead
to post-synaptic receptor desensitisation, reducing post-synaptic signalling. In the
short-term, the desensitisation would most likely represent a phosphorylation of the
receptor by G-protein receptor kinases and the subsequent recruitment ofβ-arrestin
preventing an interaction between the G-protein and the receptor. In the longer term,
desensitisation would lead to internalisation of the receptor potentially contributing
to the age-related decrease in 5-HT receptor expression. In the absence of
desensitisation, signalling through the post-synaptic 5-HT receptors is going to be
altered with signalling through 5-HT1A, B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT4 and 6receptors being
weakened, whilst other receptors would be strengthened (5-HT 7 ), with similar
potentiation observed at the 5-HT2C,Dand 5-HT3, 5receptors, although no data
could be found on how the expression of these latter receptors change with increas-
ing age. The effects of age on 5-HT signalling are summarised in Table15.4.

###### Ability of 5-HT to Regulate Lifespan

Studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s were thefirst to show that organismal
ageing was a genetically malleable trait. These studies demonstrated that mutations
inC. elegansinsulin-like growth factor receptor,daf-2, were able to double lifespan
(Friedman and Johnson, 1988 ; Kenyon et al. 1993 ; Kimura et al. 1997 ).Daf-2is part
of a complex insulin signalling pathway that acts to connect nutrient levels in the
environment to metabolism, growth, development and longevity (Murphy and Hu,
2013 ). These studies were vitally important as they showed that it was possible to
intervene in the ageing process. The lifespan-extending effects of the daf-2 mutant
require daf-16 a forkhead box transcription factor (FOXO) that is involved in
regulating the animal’s response to stress (Gottlieb and Ruvkun, 1994 ), see
Fig. 15.6. Wild typeDaf-2inhibits the translocation ofdaf-16to the nucleus strongly
inferring that translocation to the nucleus is important for longevity.
This pathway is conserved across a range of organisms and shortly after the work
onC. elegansstudies demonstrated that mutations in the singleDrosophilainsulin
receptordInR, could extend lifespan (Clancy et al. 2001 ) as could mutations in the
insulin receptor substrate,chico(Tatar et al. 2001 ). These early studies are reviewed
in more detail by Kannan and Fridell (Kannan and Fridell, 2013 ). Subsequent studies
in mice demonstrated that reduced insulin and insulin-like growth factor signalling
was also capable of extending lifespan (Brown-Borg et al. 1996 ) demonstrating that
the ability to prolong lifespan was conserved through evolution (Partridge and
Gems, 2002 ).
The proportion of the population over the age of 65 years is set to double between
now and 2050 (United Nations, 2015 ,Office for National Statistics, 2021 ). This
increase in older people should be celebrated, but given that ageing is the number
one risk factor for a range of diseases, this brings with it the potential for huge
economic costs, in healthcare needs. Interestingly, many studies have shown that
extending lifespan also extends health span in animal models leading to a wealth of
research to further understand the regulation of lifespan.
A number of studies in invertebrates have demonstrated that 5-HT signalling is
capable of regulating lifespan. Studies to determine the differences in longevity
between two strains ofDrosophilaidentified a quantitative trait locus for DOPA
decarboxylase. DOPA decarboxylase is the enzyme that catalyses the last step in the
formation of both 5-HT and dopamine suggesting the involvement of these amines
in longevity (De Luca et al. 2003 ). Analysis of the lifespan of a range ofC. elegans
mutants showed that a mutation in tryptophan hydroxylase gene (tph-1mutant)
failed to extend lifespan. However, a deletion mutation in theSer-15-HT receptor
(equivalent to mammalian 5-HT2Areceptor) significantly extended lifespan whilst
mutations in Ser-4 (equivalent to the mammalian 5-HT1Areceptor) shortened
lifespan although these effects failed to reach significance (p<0.07) (Murakami
and Murakami, 2007 ). Interestingly, the lifespan-extending effects of the deletion
mutation in Ser-1 were blocked using daf-16 (RNAi) suggesting that the effects of
5-HT were via insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS) pathway. Further


398 S. Fidalgo and M.S. Yeoman

Fig. 15.6Summary diagram showing how changes in insulin signalling can extend lifespan in
C. elegans. Adapted from Miller et al. (2020)

evidence supporting the involvement of IIS in the regulation of lifespan comes from
observations that 5-HT can directly target the daf-16/FOXO signalling pathway inC.
elegans(Liang et al. 2006 ). Two additional studies have shown that antidepressants
that target 5-HT signalling, namely mianserin and methiothepin can both regulate
lifespan (Zarse and Ristow, 2008 ; Petrascheck et al. 2007 ). Both drugs were shown
to have their effects via the IIS signalling cascade as mutations in daf-2 and daf-16
significantly attenuated the lifespan-extending effects of the drugs (Petrascheck et al.
2007 ). However, the two studies showed opposite results on lifespan with one
showing lifespan-extending effects (Petrascheck et al. 2007 ), whilst the other
showed lifespan-shortening effects (Zarse and Ristow, 2008 ). The pharmacology
of the drugs used is complicated with both drugs having effects on 5-HT 1 and 5-HT 2
receptors as well as having off-target effects on other neurotransmitter systems.


15 Age-Related Changes in Central Nervous System 5-Hydroxytryptamine... 399

Given the opposing effects of 5-HT1A(Ser-4) and 5-HT2A(Ser-1)C. elegans
receptors on lifespan (Murakami and Murakami, 2007 ), it is possible that the
different culture conditions highlighted by Zarase and Ristow are responsible for
the differences in results as these could have affected the density or distribution of
these two 5-HT receptors in the two different studies leading to the discrepancy in
the data.
5-HT signalling was also shown to affect lifespan inDrosophila(Talaei and
Atyabi, 2013 ). The authors fedDrosophilathe selective 5-HT2Areceptor antagonist
ketanserin by mixing it in their food. Ketanserin was shown to increase lifespan by
35%, although while the mechanisms of action were not explored directly in
Drosophila, the authors did show that ketanserin had anti-ageing effects on human
skinfibroblasts by decreasing the activity of mTOR, stimulating autophagy and
wound closure and decreasing oxidative stress.
Taken together these data infer that active 5-HT signalling can shorten lifespan
through the activation of the 5-HT 2 -type of receptor whilst activation of the 5-HT 1 -
type receptor can increase lifespan inC. elegans.
More recent work exploring this area of research has examined how an animal’s
perception of its food can regulate lifespan. Interestingly, 5-HT signalling can
regulate our body’s response to the perception of food, affect the physical intake
of food, what food is ingested and how much food is ingested. In addition, it is able
to prepare the body for the intake of nutrients by deciding where the nutrients go and
how they are metabolised. Together these effects are likely to contribute to the ability
of 5-HT to regulate lifespan.
Work usingC. eleganswas thefirst to demonstrate the sensory modulation of
lifespan (Apfeld and Kenyon, 1999 ). They showed that disruption to the structure or
sensory pathways in the amphid organs that contact the external environment of the
worm could extend lifespan. These disruptions were shown not to affect feeding rate,
reproduction or development suggesting that the effects on lifespan were solely due
to altered sensory perception. Interestingly, whilst disruption of some sensory
neurons extended lifespan (ASI, ASG, AWA and AWC), loss of others shortened
lifespan (ASK) (Alcedo and Kenyon, 2004 ).
InDrosophila,theperception of live yeast, a major food source ofDrosophila,
was able to partially reverse the lifespan extension observed following dietary
restriction (Libert et al. 2007 ). In mammals, the work linking sensory perception
to lifespan is less advanced. Olfactory dysfunction is a strong predictor of 5-year
mortality although this most likely represents some underlying problem with the
nervous system rather than being the primary driver of mortality (Pinto et al. 2014 ).
Interestingly,whilst the effects of olfactory and gustatory neurons on lifespan have
been little studied, work exploring the potential role of TRPV1 sensory nerves in
regulating lifespan has shown that they are capable of antagonising insulin signalling
(Melnyk and Himms-Hagen, 1995 ), a pathway that is involved in lifespan regulation
in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Additionally, inhibition of the main transmitter
of TRPV1 sensory neurons, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), can restore
metabolic health in old mice as does a genetic deletion of TRPV1 (Riera et al. 2014 ).

The precise mechanisms underlying the effects of CGRP on lifespan are currently
unknown.

###### Molecular Mechanisms Involved in Sensory Regulation

###### of Lifespan by 5-HT

Food in the environment is capable of activating IIS. Indeed, worms,flies and mice
that have disrupted IIS have extended lifespans (Partridge and Gems, 2002 ). There-
fore, it is easy to see the link between food perception and lifespan in a wide range of
organisms. Many lines of evidence show crosstalk between IIS signalling pathways
and 5-HT inC. elegans(Sze et al. 2000 ; Liang et al. 2006 ) andDrosophila(Luo
et al. 2012 ). However, the ability of sensory perception to impact lifespan is not
solely down to altered IIS. Indeed, recent work has explored in more detail the
molecular mechanisms underlying how sensory perception of food can influence
lifespan and has found strong links between 5-HT signalling pathways and lifespan.
InC. eleganslongevity is not only linked to nutrient resources in the environment
but also to temperature and oxygen levels (Miller et al. 2020 ). In both cases, the
presence of hypoxia or heat stress leads to the production of 5-HT which impacts the
stress response by inhibiting the translocation ofdaf-16to the nucleus and as a
consequence reducing lifespan (Fig.15.7). In the case of hypoxia, the effects of
5-HT are inhibited in Ser-1 mutants suggesting the involvement of the 5-HT2A
receptor. In the case of heat stress the downstream 5-HT receptor is likelySer-7a
homologue of the 5-HT 7 receptor found in mammals.
Research usingDrosophilahas generated some profound and interesting results
concerning the impact that sensory perception has on lifespan and the involvement
of 5-HT in this process (Miller et al. 2020 ).

###### Effects of Dead Conspecifics on Lifespan and the Role of 5-HT

Work by Chakraborty and colleagues has shown thatDrosophilalifespan can be
regulated through a combination of the visual and olfactory cues of dead conspe-
cifics (Chakraborty et al. 2019 ). The lifespan-shortening effects required that: the
flies were not killed by freezing; were recently dead (<11 days); and deadflies were
a closely related species to theflies under test. The observation that both visual and
olfactory cues were important suggests that the testflies can both recognise a
conspecific and presumably determine the time and type of death through olfactory
cues. Interestingly, the ability of dead conspecifics to attenuate lifespan was not
observed inflies administered a 5-HT2Areceptor blocker or in mutantflies that lack
the 5-HT2A receptor (Fig. 15.8). Similarly, the effects of exposure to dead

Miller et al. (2020)

conspecifics could be mimicked in naïveflies by making neurons that normally
express the 5-HT2Areceptor constitutively active when the temperature was raised
above 25°C.
As mentioned previously dietary restriction is capable of extending lifespan in a
range of animals fromC. elegans,toDrosophila, mice, non-human primates and
even humans. InDrosophila, exposure of dietary-restrictedflies to attractive food
odours attenuates the effects of dietary restriction on lifespan, although the mecha-
nism is not completely understood (Libert et al. 2007 ). The main component of food
that drives the effect of dietary restriction on lifespan is its protein content. Flies kept
on a low-protein diet will swap to ingesting protein from a primary sugar diet when
protein becomes available. This switch requires the presence of the 5-HT2Areceptor
as the switch was blocked inflies lacking functional 5-HT2Areceptors. More
interesting was the observation that whenflies were able to choose between a
fixed diet (containing 10% w/v sugar and 10% w/v protein) or a choice diet


402 S. Fidalgo and M.S. Yeoman

consisting of protein (10% w/v) and sugar (10% w/v) presented separately, lifespan
was decreased. This decrease, which was particularly strong in males, did not depend
on the amount of sugar and protein ingested as this was essentially the same between
groups, but was dependent on the level of protein in the choice diet (Lyu et al.
2021b). Previous studies had shown that the 5-HT2Areceptor was important for
determining the choice of a protein diet (Ro et al. 2016 ). Using afly strain with a
P-element insertion in the promotor region of the 5-HT2Areceptor gene produced a
fly with a loss of function of the 5HT2Areceptor. Using this strain blocked the effect
of food choice on lifespan, strongly suggesting that 5-HT signalling through the
5-HT2Areceptor is important for regulating lifespan changes due to food choice (Lyu
et al.2021b). The authors further showed that knockdown of glutamate dehydroge-
nase a key component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was also capable of
abrogating the effects of food choice on lifespan suggesting a link between 5-HT2A

Fig. 15.9 The effects of dietary restriction and food choice on longevity require 5-HT acting via a

receptor signalling and the TCA cycle. In a recent paper, Lyu and colleagues have
further investigated the mechanism by which nutrient choice decreases lifespan (Lyu
et al.2021a). In this paper, they demonstrate that nutrient choice changes the state of
metabolic networks from one that is highly connected and robust to one that is
fragmented and fragile. Importantly, these changes were also dependent on the
5HT2Areceptor. The authors proposed that these changes are important as they
may allow the animals to adapt their physiology to match the availability of key
nutrients in their environment and that in turn, this may increasefitness (Fig.15.9).
Finally, Miller and colleagues have further explored how the perception of food
odours can attenuate the lifespan-extending effects of dietary restriction (Miller et al.
2022 ). In this paper, the authors confirm the work of Libert and colleagues (Libert
et al. 2007 ) by showing that exposure to attractive food odours in the absence of food
ingestion can abrogate the effects of dietary restriction on lifespan. In addition, they
show that mianserin, a 5-HT receptor antagonist, is capable of blocking the effects of
attractive food odours and increases longevity. Given that mianserin can block both
Ser-1(5-HT2A) andSer-4(5-HT1A) receptors and that both receptors have previ-
ously been shown to be important in regulating lifespan (Petrascheck et al. 2007 ), it
was important to determine which receptor was involved in allowing attractive
odours to block the lifespan-extending effects of calorie restriction. Using a series
of knockdown experiments, the authors showed thatSer-4appeared to be the main
receptor involved in the perception of attractant odours. Conditional knockouts
strongly suggested that this receptor was located in the nervous system.

###### So How Does the Natural Ageing Process and 5-HT Signalling

###### Interact?

The research highlighted in the previous section has demonstrated convincingly that
5-HT can affect lifespan in a range of invertebrate species. More specifically, 5-HT is
capable of decreasing lifespan, mainly through its effects on the 5-HT2Areceptor,
but also with involvement of the 5-HT1Areceptor. It is interesting to note that during
the natural ageing process both these receptors are downregulated in higher organ-
isms, suggesting that as animals age signalling through the 5-HT2Aand to a lesser
extent the 5-HT1Areceptor is impaired. Given that signalling through these two
receptors can decrease lifespan it is interesting to speculate that a compensatory
decrease in receptor expression in old age may act to try to maintain organismal
function albeit by reducing signalling through pathways that act to shorten lifespan.
Indeed, whilst reduced signalling through the 5-HT2Aand 5-HT1Areceptors may
bring beneficial effects to lifespan, the trade-off detrimental effects should not be
underestimated. Reduced signalling through 5-HT2Areceptors would decrease the
flexibility/plasticity of the metabolic pathways to adapt to the environmental changes
in nutrient availability. In terms offitness, this is not an issue as most of the changes
observed in receptor expression occur at a time of life where fecundity is very low or
non-existent. However, this may seriously impact the ability of the animal to choose
the appropriate nutrients to maintain homeostasis (i.e. the lack of ability to select
appropriate protein diet if required). Additionally, 5-HT is an important regulator of
olfaction in rodents (Gaudry, 2018 ) and 5-HT2Aand 5-HT1A, Breceptors are crucial
to the function of this sense. Therefore, a further detriment to the observed
downregulation of these receptors with increasing age is that sensory perception of
food will be impaired, which in humans is critical to taste and the palatability of
food. Together, the potential for ageing to decrease theflexibility of metabolic
systems and to reduce the palatability of food could contribute significantly to a
condition known as anorexia of ageing, defined as a failure to ingest an adequate
amount of food to meet their essential energy and nutrient requirements (Landi et al.
2016 ).
Of course, there are several caveats to this interpretation of the data that elude to a
requirement for experiments to be carried out in the future. First, whilst 5-HT levels
in the CNS of bothC. elegansandDrosophilahave been shown to decline with
increasing age, no data is available detailing how the expression of the 5-HT 1 and
5-HT 2 receptors changes over the life course of these animals. Second, the data
presented at the beginning of this chapter has focused strongly on receptor expres-
sion in the CNS and not in the periphery and whilst some of the effects described in
the invertebrates above rely on central serotonergic signalling, namely those
described forDrosophila, theC. elegansdata requires the involvement of peripheral
5-HT receptors located in the intestine and how these receptors change with increas-
ing age is currently not known. Finally, whilst we have tried to illustrate that similar
serotonergic signalling mechanisms may be present in higher organisms including
humans this has yet to be determined.


15 Age-Related Changes in Central Nervous System 5-Hydroxytryptamine... 405

In summary, the recent work by Miller and colleagues (Miller et al. 2020 , Miller
et al. 2022 ) has opened a new chapter in the role of 5-HT in the nervous system and
the potential to develop therapeutics to target the serotonergic system to improve
health span in our ageing population.

Abstract The ageing process is highly complex involving multiple processes
operating at different biological levels. Systems Biology presents an approach
using integrative computational and laboratory study that allows us to address
such complexity. The approach relies on the computational analysis of knowledge
and data to generate predictive models that may be validated with further laboratory
experimentation. Our understanding of ageing is such that translational opportunities
are within reach and systems biology offers a means to ensure that optimal decisions
are made. We present an overview of the methods employed from bioinformatics
and computational modelling and describe some of the insights into ageing that have
been gained.

###### Introduction

Ageing is an inherently complex process driven by dysregulation in intracellular
molecular reactions to entire organ systems. At the cellular level, ageing phenotypes
are associated with changes to complex molecular networks arising from genomic
instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated
nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaus-
tion, and altered intercellular communication, as highlighted by López-Otín et al.
(2013) as the hallmarks of ageing. These cellular phenotypes may differ from cell to
cell and between cell types and their host tissues, so that the ageing phenotype is one

of the highest complexity. A full understanding necessitates a hybrid reductionist-
integrative strategy addressing the multiple levels of complexity in a systematic
manner. Individual contributions may be addressed initially as isolated systems and
then combined with other contributions to build up an integrative view. This is the
basis of systems biology. It adopts principles and methodologies from computer
science, physics, engineering, and mathematics together with experimental biology
to gain a mechanistic understanding of biological systems and networks (Kirkwood
2011 ). The methodologies employed in computational systems biology are primarily
data mining with bioinformatic analysis and/or computational or mathematical
simulation-based analysis. The former, known as the top-down approach, is used
to gather knowledge from large biological datasets, resulting in the formulation of a
hypothesis. Whereas a bottom-up approach of simulation-based analysis allows the
testing of a hypothesis using in silico models to make predictions, which can aid the
design of in vivo and in vitro experiments (Kitano 2002 ). Applying a systems
biology approach brings together existing data and knowledge from disparate and
individual experiments to provide the details of the underlying complexity without
which we could never truly understand the mechanisms of ageing.

###### Bioinformatics

Bioinformatic methods are used in top-down systems biology. The overall purpose is
to probe omic data to identify molecules and subsystems involved in ageing. The
first stage in bioinformatic analysis involves linking experimental observations from
many sources to create an interconnected framework of key interactions, generating
modular, cohesive and interconnected networks which can describe the system as a
whole (Song et al. 2018 ). A variety of computational tools, databases, reporting and
formatting standards have been developed for use by ageing researchers (Wieser
et al. 2011 ); however, the integration, interpretation, formatting, storage and sharing
of data, clinical and phenotypic information remain major challenges (Dato et al.
2021 ).
Developments in biotechnology, technology, sequencing, bioinformatics/com-
puting, statistics, as well as reductions in costs and increases in speed have enabled
biologists to generate data sets covering entire genomes, transcriptomes,
epigenomes, metabolomes, lipidomes, proteomes, protein conformation, and protein
binding from a single experiment. Moreover, we can observe changes in these large
datasets throughout the life-course of individual organisms and cells (Dato et al.
2021 ; Song et al. 2018 ). Transcriptomics no longer requires RNAs to be captured
using poly-A tails, enabling measurement of non-protein-coding RNA and isoforms,
identifying functional roles for non-coding‘junk DNA’(Bainbridge et al. 2006 ;
Palazzo and Gregory 2014 ; Pettersson et al. 2009 ). Extension of RNA-seq to single
cells has enabled the study of cellular variation within tissues to investigate the role
of stochasticity or the location of cells relative to key structures such as veins and
arteries. Spatial transcriptomics using technologies such as laser-based precision

slicing, in situ DNA sequence cell barcoding and spatial array image-based sequenc-
ing is opening opportunities to study the specific impacts of cellular location, cell
subtypes and cell–cell interactions on health and disease states. The size and
complexity of resulting data, technical noise and the scale of genomic, epigenetic
and transcriptomic interactions represent major future challenges in bioinformatics
and systems biology alike (Aldridge and Teichmann 2020 ; Rao et al. 2021 ). An
overview of the evolution of transcriptomics technologies is shown in Fig.16.1.
Figure16.1 presents therapid expansion of omic analysis which can be illustrated
in the study of senescent cells. Initial studies used microarray data to assess the
expression of specific RNAs between proliferating cells and cells that had divided
until uncapped telomeres prevented further division (Zhang et al. 2003 ). However,
our understanding of senescent cells evolved alongside omic technologies, and later
studies used RNA-seq to identify the differential expression of existing as well as
novel transcripts at specific timepoints during senescence induction (Young et al.
2009 ). This utilised multiple types of senescence that unlike replicative senescence
could be induced at a point of choosing. More recent studies included large numbers
of interventions to identify the mechanisms behind cellular senescence (Georgilis
et al. 2018 ). The role of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in
paracrine senescence induction (Acosta et al. 2013 ), and the role of Notch signalling
in juxtacrine senescence induction (Hoare et al. 2016 ) were both identified in part
from transcriptomic data, which also allowed an unbiased comparison between
the profiles of these new types of senescence and the initial inducer-senescent
cells. These studies helped to enrich our understanding of cell senescence, and
studies such as Hernandez-Segura et al. ( 2017 ) used meta-analyses of existing
transcriptomic data to identify universal markers of senescent cells. Later studies
did the same for proteomics (Basisty et al. 2020 ; Neri et al. 2021 ), while single-cell
transcriptomics revealed subpopulations within populations of senescent cells from
the same mode of induced arrest (Chen et al. 2020 ).


418 S. Chandrasegaran et al.

Single-cell transcriptomics has also been used to create an atlas of ageing in mice
(Tabula Muris Senis), identifying double the proportion of cells expressing the
senescence marker CDKN2A in older mice (Almanzar et al. 2020 ). Thisfinding
was corroborated by Uyar et al. ( 2020 ) analysing data from multi-tissue mouse
single-cell transcriptomic data sets. They identified that the highest proportion of
cells expressing ten (pre-specified) senescence-associated genes were found in the
liver, with Interleukin 1β(IL1β), a cytokine involved in inflammageing, showing the
highest expression. Thus, bioinformatic analysis helps us identify the important
molecules in ageing using unbiased methodologies. Computational modelling can
then be used to put these molecules in context to establish their importance within
networks of interacting molecules.

###### Computational Modelling

Models can be dynamic or static, discrete or continuous and stochastic or determin-
istic, to reflect the system being modelled and the hypothesis being tested. Dynamic
models explore how variables evolve temporally, while static models explore a
process at a given timepoint. Dynamic models are a more useful tool as processes
inevitably undergo temporal change with age, for example Dalle Pezze et al. (2014)
useddynamic modelling techniques to investigate mitochondrial function in cellular
senescence. Living systems are by definition dynamic but often achieve prolonged
periods of homeostasis which sometimes lend themselves to static mathematical
modelling. Discrete variables have defined integer values, while continuous vari-
ables have an infinite number of states or values in between discrete integers.
Stochastic models account for the randomness of cellular processes—cellular and
genetic damage is random and is therefore an example of an age-related stochastic
behaviour. Examples of stochastic modelling include the Sozou and Kirkwood
(2001) model which investigated the heterogeneity in entry of cells into cellular
senescence, and the Proctor et al. ( 2005 ) study which used stochastic modelling to
investigate the role of molecular chaperones in ageing. On the other hand, deter-
ministic models have set initial parameter values and initial conditions which are not
influenced by random dynamics. Models can also have a spatial element that
incorporates not just the levels of the various molecules but their positions relative
to each other on a two- or even three-dimensional plane. This can involve the use of
partial differential equations such as in reaction-diffusion equations (Turing 1952 ),
grid-like systemssuch as cellular potts models (Graner and Glazier 1992 ), or agent-
based systems where elements such as cells or macromolecules are modelled as
agents with defined position and motion (Byrne and Drasdo 2008 ). Common ways to
model systems with these frameworks are shown in Fig.16.2, adapted from Mc
Auley et al. ( 2017 ). When variables do not have predetermined values from exper-
imental data, modellers can utilise parameter estimations to guide variable behav-
iour, determining how different values affect model dynamics. Parameter estimation
is a particularly challenging task in developing computational models: success is


16 Systems Biology of Ageing 419

often dependent on data quality and quantity, requiring careful selection of assump-
tions and often extensive high-performance computing resources. Multiple software
packages are available but additional programming is often required (Hoops et al.
2006 ; Welsh et al. 2018 ).
One example of successfully using a model to investigate a gap in knowledge was
by Sozou and Kirkwood ( 2001 ) who wanted to understand why there was hetero-
geneity in cell division potential and entry into replicative senescence, as the
shortening of telomeres on its own could not account for the heterogeneity observed.
The model suggested that oxidative damage from mitochondrial ROS alongside
nuclear somatic mutations could contribute to the observed heterogeneity in the
number of cell divisions before cells entered replicative senescence. The model
findings were later reinforced by Passos et al. ( 2007 ) through experiments which
showed that the production of mitochondrial superoxide increases with replicative
cell age. They further showed that mild mitochondrial uncoupling led to reduced
superoxide generation, slowed telomere shortening and delayed replicative senes-
cence entry, demonstrating the importance of mitochondrial ROS in contributing
towards the heterogeneity of cell entry into replicative senescence.
Computational modelling has been widely used to investigate the oscillatory
nature of the p53 response (Geva-Zatorsky et al. 2006 ; Proctor and Gray 2008 ),
the role of molecular chaperones in ageing (Proctor et al. 2005 ; Proctor and Lorimer
2011 ), mitochondrial function in ageing and senescence (Dalle Pezze et al. 2014 ;
Passos et al. 2010 ), and the dysregulation of various signalling pathways with age
(Hui et al. 2016 ; Smith and Shanley 2010 ). As well as modelling specific processes
which occur in ageing, computational models can investigate the molecular level of
age-related diseases—for example the role of cytokine interactions in rheumatoid
arthritis has been modelled (Baker et al. 2013 ), as has the role of amyloid-βdimer
aggregation in Alzheimer’s disease (Proctor et al. 2012 ).


420 S. Chandrasegaran et al.

Many modelling studies are conducted in collaboration with laboratory-based
research allowing the model to inform the experiments and vice versa. For example,
Dalle Pezze et al. ( 2014 ) combined in silico and in vitro experimental approaches to
explore the role of different signalling molecules in cellular senescence and mito-
chondrial function. They experimentally identified that inhibition of ROS or mTOR
partially rescued the dysfunctional mitochondrial phenotype observed in senescent
cells, developing a model which replicated these outcomes and predicted the effects
of dual inhibition which they then confirmed experimentally. Although the inter-
ventions were not able to completely prevent mitochondrial dysfunction in senes-
cence, the model identified that mitochondrialfission may drive the increased
mitochondrial mass found in senescence.
Another example of successful collaboration between computational and exper-
imental biologists is the work by Passos et al. ( 2010 ) who used modelling alongside
in silico interactome analysis and live cell microscopy to identify a dynamic
feedback loop between p21 and ROS in cellular senescence by which DNA damage
activated p21 through p53 which then increased ROS production to increase DNA
damage and thus ensure permanent cell cycle arrest.
A good understanding of the underlying intracellular molecular events is crucial
to study the ageing process, informing when higher level phenotypes such as
functional decline and disease should manifest both for individual organisms and
even at the population level through the use of multiscale modelling.

###### Multiscale Models of Ageing

Ageing is a systemic phenomenon resulting from complex interactions between
multiple functional and organisational levels, including interactions between cells
and between cells and their surrounding microenvironment. These include the
biomechanical forces affecting cells and the dynamics of tissue-level organisation.
These processes operate across different spatiotemporal domains, making ageing a
multiscale problem consisting of age-related defects at the level of molecules, cells,
tissues and organs all contributing to the whole-body frailty and disease we define as
ageing (Kirkwood2005b).
One approach to addressing a multiscale system is through the construction of
cell-based models representing a system such as a tissue as an aggregate of individ-
ual agents (cells), each with its own set of distinct characteristics and mechanisms.
This type of framework allows us to take an integrative approach by analysing the
spatiotemporal dynamics of individual elements and how they collectively result in a
particular phenotype. Furthermore, multi-cell models have the capacity to combine
different model types of varying resolution, for example an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) model, to dictate individual cell behaviour, coupled with an agent-
based model to ascertain tissue-level behaviour. In keeping with this, Martinez
Guimera et al. ( 2017 ) developed a multi-cell senescence model coupled with an
intracellular ODE model of irradiation-induced senescence (Dalle Pezze et al. 2014 ).


16 Systems Biology of Ageing 421

The model showed that a tissue level of just 10% senescent cells could be sufficient
to drive a whole tissue into senescence, highlighting the importance of the bystander
effect (Acosta et al. 2013 ; Nelson et al. 2012 ). Additionally, further model simula-
tions showed that senescent cell clearance by immune cells largely determined
progression of the model towards a steady state, suggesting that targeted immuno-
therapy against senescent cells would be a more effective therapeutic approach than
targeting the SASP.
Other approaches to multiscale modelling include whole-body modelling, which
integrates molecular and physiological data to study whole-body metabolism. For
instance, Mc Auley et al. ( 2012 ) developed a set of ODEs representing a whole-body
model of cholesterol metabolism to explore how changes in Low-Density Lipopro-
tein Cholesterol (LDL-C) clearance by the liver and absorption by the intestine
contributed to the age-related rise in plasma LDL-C. The multiscale nature of
cholesterol metabolism was addressed in the model through compartmentalisation
of the various processes involved including cholesterol intake, synthesis of intestinal
cholesterol, excretion and clearance from the plasma, hepatic and peripheral tissue.
Their results suggested clearance by the liver was the more pertinent factor.
Although multiscale modelling in ageing is still in its infancy, some notable work
has been done to explore the evolution of ageing. Nelson and Masel ( 2017 ) devel-
oped a series of equations for changes in cell vigour and cooperativity which
suggested that ageing might be an unavoidable result of mutations that reduced the
cooperativity or increased the vigour of cells relative to wild-type cells. This ran in
stark contrast to earlier theories that suggested ageing resulted from reversible
mutations such as mutation accumulation theory (Medawar 1952 ) as well as the
likely incorrect assumption that tissue-level selection would be inconsequential to
fitness (Szathmáry and Smith 1995 ).
Goldsby et al. ( 2014 ) developed a computational model consisting of‘digital’
multicellular organisms to study the mutagenic effects of metabolism that could have
led to the evolution of division of labour between the somatic and germline cells.
The division of labour theory posits that ageing might be linked to the asymmetrical
separation of resources between reproductive functions and somatic functions such
as maintenance and repair (Kirkwood2005a). By analysing the lineages of simulated
organisms, Goldsby et al. ( 2014 ) demonstrated that organisms can evolve to harbour
the potential for cell differentiation resulting in reproductive or somatic maintenance
functions, and that somatic phenotypes could be associated with ageing, while the
reproductive cells remain protected. Similarly, Radzvilavicius et al. ( 2016 ) devel-
oped an agent-based evolutionary model showing that mitochondrialfitness drives
the evolution of the germline, and that gamete sequestration from the soma reduces
mutational load since copying errors in gametes are reduced. They also showed that
greater organismal complexity and higher numbers of mitochondria do not contrib-
ute to the evolution of germline sequestration. More recently, Pen and Flatt ( 2021 )
developeda simple cell-based model to investigate the role of parent–child asym-
metry in the evolution of division of labour and cellular senescence. From their
model, they concluded that parent–offspring asymmetry and the division of labour
was not required for the evolution of ageing. This claim was supported by model

simulations that showed that symmetrically reproducing cells with equally
partitioned damage, and their cell lineages, were still able to develop senescence.

###### Conclusion

Systems biology has made a significant contribution to our understanding of ageing,
and its potential will only increase with ongoing development of associated tech-
nologies. However, as the systems addressed become more extended the technical
expertise required to understand them also rises, and communicating the results
becomes increasingly difficult. Progress is highly dependent on the understanding
developed using the reductionist approach, without which we could not hope to
build models or comprehend large omic datasets, but it is also true that we cannot
hope to understand the significance of reductionist approaches to complex systems
without the approaches and techniques described in this chapter.
Biological systems do not always behave in expected ways, reflecting feedback
loops, tipping points, levers, hubs, stable states, self-organisation, distributed con-
trol, emergence and non-linearity among other phenomena that are not easily
understood without big picture, unbiased datasets and computational models. Suc-
cessful interventions to slow or prevent the ageing process will necessitate in large
part an understanding of the underlying complexities developed through these
methods.
